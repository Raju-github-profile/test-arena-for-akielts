    %%An informal conversation with an examiner that lasts between 11 and 14 minutes is called "IELTS SPEAKING."Nonetheless, in the Coronavirus time when the investigate is being taken essentially, it goes on for 20 minutes.The academic and regular modules' speaking tests are identical.It evaluates the candidate's grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, and fluency.The talking look at module consists of three parts.The first section focuses on you.The second section is about you and other people, places, and a mix of the two.The third phase is essentially about other people, and you must respond to approximately 0.33 people.
    %%Speaking in "the other person's" language is no longer a useful skill.Although a Nepalese student may believe that speaking is easy, it is not.Why?Am I being mean to you?No!I would like you to imagine going back to your school days and thinking about each and every day you spent there.How many times did your trainer tell you to speak in English, and how many of those times did you follow through?Also, think about how many times you did the reading or at least read the directions in the book.I'm going to guess that only 20% of the debt is owed.How frequently have you read English-language publications, Facebook news, or listened to English-language television programming?Is it not?You may also have eight or nine English-language books, but you didn't answer the question?Did you speak English with your friend?Yes, you did for a brief period of time until the most stringent instructor appears, following the instructor's departure;The teacher liked your English speaking, doesn't it?
   %% Therefore, you should be able to communicate effectively within two months, rather than 12 years of English schooling.You struggle with speaking because of this.Let's get over it now and try to find ways to improve your speaking.Listening to other people speak and attempting to communicate in English is the only way to improve speakme.That's all.
    %%Mirror practice is a method that is very precise.Try talking to yourself while looking in the mirror.We are holding a recorder.Record your speech on your phone and listen to it later. If you think you're not happy with how you spoke, repeat the process until you are convinced.Watching a lot of American and British movies and reciting the dialogue with the actors is another way to improve your speaking skills.You will gain more fluency and vocabulary from this.Training your tongue is necessary for speaking.Therefore, your tongue will learn %%Usage* - by itself* %% if you repeat the dialogues.In the same way, you should download apps from Google Play or the app store that help you talk.However, speaking with your partner, friends, or family is the best way to learn how to talk.You will begin speaking fluently once you overcome your shyness and hesitation.`

   %% You are not selected by the examiner to perform the following tasks.
   %% • Act like you've memorized your response.
   %% • Make erroneous use of large, fancy words.
   %% • Incorrectly employ unique grammatical structures
    %%• Concentrating on speaking with an Australian, British, or American accent.
   %% However, the examiner DOES want to see:
   %% • How well you speak spoken English, in percentage terms.
    %%• It is essential to keep in mind that the examiners on the IELTS Speaking test are purely evaluating your capacity to speak and communicate in English.They won't be able to choose you or mark you if you continue to act like a statue and keep your mouth shut.
   %% Don't make it any more difficult than it needs to be.Keep it brief!
    %%The four parts of the IELTS Speaking marking criteria are as follows:
    %%1.Pronunciation: %%2. percent Lexical Resource %%3. percentAccuracy and grammatical range: %%4.Coherence and Fluency

    description: `
    %%1.Using English on a daily basis.*
   %% Every band 7+ student speaks a little bit of English on a daily basis.If you want to do well in speaking, you should practice a little bit of English every day.Practicing for half an hour in the middle of the day is not nearly as difficult as avoiding a bullet.
    %%2.If you don't understand something on the test, ask the examiner to repeat the question.*
   %% Always keep in mind that the IELTS talking test simulates a conversation between two people.If you think about it as a test, you might also get nervous, but if you pretend to talk to a friend, it will be much easier.Therefore, you can ask the examiner to repeat the question for you if you no longer comprehend it.You can ask, "Could you please repeat the question?" or "I apologize, could you explain what "the word" means?"I beg to be excused!”You can ask the examiner to repeat the question, but you should never ask them to explain the question.
   %% However, if you receive a topic that is unfamiliar to you, you can always inform the examiner that you are unaware of the topic and that it does not relate to your own trip, but you must provide an explanation for your lack of knowledge.You could likewise of way solicitation to trade the inquiry.You will be explaining something that will reveal your vocabulary, fluency, pronunciation, and grammar skills as you explain why you are unable to answer the question.Because no two people in the world provide exactly the same response to the same question, everything you say needs to be logically related, and you don't need to worry about whether your response is correct or incorrect.Always remember to communicate effectively with the examiner.
   %% You can usually lie if you don't want to answer the question, which is a good idea, or if you don't want to answer the question.IELTS is no longer a test with a lie detector.Nevertheless, I do not intend for you to lie.If you lie, you may also be targeted for harassment and lose your way.Rather than pausing or stopping, the best idea is to imagine and discuss other people's rides.
    %%3.Warm up sooner than you face the inspector.*
   %% Usually, it's a good idea to warm up before the exam.Before you enter the check room, try working toward it with your friends, instructor, or family.Only speak in English the day before the test.Even though your friends and family might think you're crazy, it will be very helpful.
    %%4.Answer all questions.*
   %% One-word responses are unacceptable.You won't get good marks just by saying "Yes" or "No."Use complete sentences.Just think about the basis on which the examiner will decide whether to give you marks or just say "sure" or "no."Always add justification to your responses, and it's better to back up with an example, like in assignment 2.
    %%5.Make your errors right.*
   %% You are not a native speaker, and everyone makes mistakes when they speak.Therefore, don't worry if you make a few mistakes.When you make mistakes on the exam, you should be worried because you know you made a mistake but don't fix it.Correct it as soon as you realize you made a mistake and move on.When you make a minor error, be sincere in your apology and correctly repeat the sentence.`

%% Idiom*s are a crucial component of any language, and English is no exception. They are used by almost all native speakers.Idiom*s are used by all native English speakers, and you will be able to produce band 8 answers if you use them during the speaking test.Although idioms in English don't always make sense literally, you should be familiar with these.It seems difficult at first, but once you start using it almost every time you speak, it becomes fun.
Four events will occur before the beginning of Part 1.
%% 1.The examiner will first attempt to calm you down by introducing themselves and then asking your name.Remember to use contractions in this part, just in case.Start by saying, "My name is so and so," for instance.If you do this, you will remember that the rest of the conversation requires contractions.
%% 2.You will be asked, "What can I call you?" by the examiner.You can say, "You can call me so and so," for example.Inform them of your alternative name, but keep in mind that you must be able to pronounce your name clearly.It will be a very awkward situation for you if you cannot correctly pronounce your name, and it will not make the best first impression.Simply use your passport's name if you don't have any other name.
%% 3.They will then inquire about your origins.Simply state your hometown."I am from Birtamode, a city in the Jhapa District," for instance.At this point, there is no need to provide any additional information.
%% 4.The examiner will request your passport as proof of identity following all of this.The test will begin when you demonstrate it to them.
%% What should and shouldn't you do in this section of the speaking test?
%% %%• Make a good first impression:
%% When speaking, it is beneficial to look someone in the eye;It demonstrates your self-assurance, but staring into the examiner's eyes for fifteen minutes is extremely awkward.The most compelling thing here isn't looking at without flinching, or looking shrewd or keeping the grin, yet it is looking or sounding certain.
%% %%• Make it look like you're interested in the question Even if you don't like the question or are bored, pretend to be interested.Assume you are excited to answer the question and are interested in it.Why?Because you will sound stale and uninteresting if you demonstrate boredom.Your intonation will not be affected by this when you speak.Words are pronounced using innonations.For instance, when you are happy, your voice is higher, whereas when you are sad, it is lower.Therefore, if you're bored, you might pronounce the words similarly.
%% %%• Give longer responses because the examiner won't be able to evaluate you fully with short responses.But it won't sound natural if you answer in very long sentences.For instance, if you are asked about your hobby, answering "stamp collection is my hobby" will be too brief, and the examiner will not be able to tell that you speak English well.Therefore, two to three sentences will suffice.
%% %%• Practice Prior to officially beginning my speaking classes in my classroom, I instruct my Nepalese students to write down their questions and answers.However, it is not a good idea to memorize.We Nepalese, on the other hand, are accustomed to this, so switching to a different method of practice will not yield any results.Hence, composing replies to normal inquiries and read is better.I am not suggesting that you should memorize them; rather, read them once per day.This will help you remember when questions about the same subject come up, preventing panic.You'll feel more confident and familiar with the subject as a result.As I mentioned earlier, speaking English at school makes us students feel unpatriotic and shy;As a result, writing and reading will assist you in developing your mind and tongue.Always read aloud when you can.However, you should not sound forced during the exam;You shouldn't sound like you've memorized it.
%% %%• Record, listen, and complete.
%% Always make sure to record your responses and listen to them.It will help you improve your vocabulary, grammar, intonation, speed of speech, and pronunciation.Record your response and listen to your friend while you practice in the mirror or over the phone.By doing this you will be aware of your mix-ups and you will address it.
%% %%• Don't answer "YES" or "NO."
%% %%• Don't get off topic; %%• Don't try to be perfect; %%• Don't try to speak with an accent; %%• Don't talk too fast or too slowly; %%• Don't stay silent.

        %% What do's and don'ts do in this part of the language test?%%  %%%%• Make a good first impression:
       %% It's best to make eye contact when speaking. This shows that you are confident, but staring into the inspector's eyes for 15 minutes is really uncomfortable. The important thing here is not to look you in the eye or look smart or keep that smile, but to look or sound confident. pretend
        %%Even if you don't like the question or find it boring, fake your face. Pretend that you are interested in the question and very interested in the answer. why? Because showing that you're bored sounds boring and monotonous. This ensures that your intonation does not change when you speak. Intonation is the way words are pronounced. For example, the pitch is higher when you are happy, and the pitch is lower when you are sad. So if you're feeling bored, the words may sound similar.  %%%%• Broaden your answer
       %% A short answer will not allow the examiner to fully assess you. But answering in very long sentences sounds unnatural. For example, if you are asked about your hobbies, and you answer that your hobby is collecting stamps, it will be too short for the examiner to know that you are proficient in English. So 2-3 sentences should be enough.  %%%%• good results
       %% I encourage my Nepali students to write down their questions and answers before officially starting their language classes in the classroom. However, memorizing it is not a good idea. However, we Nepalis are used to it and will not switch to another kind of practice.Therefore, we encourage you to write or read the answers to the frequently asked questions. I'm not telling you to memorize it, just read it once a day. This will help you remember when questions about the same subject come up and prevent you from panicking. This will help you become familiar with the topic and feel a little more confident. As I said before, we as students feel shy and unpatriotic about speaking English at school. Therefore, writing and reading will help you train your tongue and your mind. When reading, be sure to read aloud. Still, it shouldn't sound unnatural on the test. It shouldn't sound like you've memorized it.  %%%%• Recording – Listening – Correct. It's always a good idea to record your answers and listen. It helps you learn speaking speed, intonation, pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar. Record and listen to your answers while practicing in the mirror or talking to a friend on the phone. This way you will recognize your mistakes and correct them.

        %%It's about you 
        %%During this part of the oral exam, the examiner will ask you about yourself. This means you will be asked about everyday questions such as your name, where you live, your work or studies, your interests and hobbies. It takes about 4-5 minutes. You should always remember that you are tagged when you speak. This part is about you, so you don't have to fake your answer. Just say in brief. That is, you should tell everything, not hide anything. Don't worry if your answer gets too long. If it goes too long, the examiner will pause and ask another question. The test can take up to 14 minutes, so it's a good idea to split the time for each question. If she speaks fluently and long, the examiner will only ask her 4-5 questions in this section. However, if you lower your voice, the examiner will continue to ask random questions. Don't go too early or too late. He should speak for 45 seconds for each question in this section.

        %%Q:How habitually do you associate with companions? [[If not, why not?
          %%Answer:We meet almost twice a week with my friends.I adore spending my weekends with them, going to different places, watching movies, and talking about a lot of different things.I don't generally go out with my companions.Three to four times per month, I typically go out with two or three of my closest friends.

          %%Answer:Sincerely, family comes first.However, there are a few friends who end up joining our family.Friends are just as important to us as family members, even though our relationships with them are typically stronger.When we are with our families and friends, we truly become who we are.
          Subject: %Names%
          Q: Did your family choose your name(s)?
          %%Answer:Indeed, my name was picked by my folks.At least in their eyes, my parents wanted me to be known well when I was born.Before I was born, my mother claims that my father brought a book of baby names.Consequently, they are my only beneficiaries.
          Q: How did your parents choose your names?
          %%Answer:I found out that they were inspired by a name they found in the book and took my grandfather's surname.Consequently, they merged the names and selected one for me.However, this was their final step in selecting my name.My knowledge has it that they had to pick from hundreds of names and spend a lot of time choosing one before settling on a name.

%%Q.In your household, who typically cooks?
%%Answer:  In our home, the cooking is done by my mother, who, as previously stated, is an exceptional cook.She always laughs when I tell her how much I admire her and how I encourage her to open a restaurant in the city.Emma, my older sister, occasionally helps my mother in the kitchen.On the other hand, I am in charge of the daily shopping and grocery shopping.
%%Q: Do you watch cooking shows on television?[Why or why not?

%%Q: In general, do you prefer to eat at home or out? [Why?]
%%Answer:  I prefer to cook at home.The nutritional value of homemade food is higher, and the selection is extensive.It is less expensive and more hygienic.However, whenever we have special occasions to celebrate, we enjoy dining out at restaurants.On occasions like wedding anniversaries and birthdays, my father and I frequently insist that my mother go to a restaurant because it gives her ample time to socialize rather than being stuck in the kitchen.
Photographs as a Subject:
%%Q: What kinds of pictures do you like to take? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  I like to experiment with both my camera and my phone's camera frequently, which is why I like to take a wide range of pictures, such as people, gifts, the sky, a river, a flower, and so on.
%%I do, however, enjoy taking pictures of people.I took some of my best photos in unidentified locations where people posed for my camera.The photograph is something to treasure because of their genuine smile, sad expression, and sometimes confusion.
%%Q: How do you use the pictures you take?
%%Answer:  I connect my camera or mobile phone to my laptop after taking about 20 to 30 photos and select the best ones.After that, I give the phones appropriate names and prepare them for upload to my Flickr account.Yahoo! owns Flickr, a great website for sharing and storing photos.and it has a lot of space for storage.I occasionally share a few photos with my friends on Instagram and Facebook.When I want to give a photo as a gift or put it in a frame, I usually print it.
%%Q: When you go to other places, do you buy postcards or take pictures?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  When I was young and went to a new place with my parents, I used to buy postcards.Perhaps I did this so that I could bring back mementos of my travels.However, thanks to the growing popularity of smartphones and cameras, we are now able to frame our own photographs and videos and store them digitally.We are more likely to take pictures and videos these days and then share them with friends and family rather than buying souvenirs, particularly postcards.
%%Q: Do you enjoy having pictures taken of you? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  I don't mind if someone asks me first if I want to be photographed.Aside from that, I prefer not to be in a photograph, especially with people who are less well-known or unknown to me.I don't think this is a personal choice, and I don't like to occasionally take a selfie or self-photo.
Subject: Bicycles:
%%Q: How prevalent are bicycles in your area? [Why?]
%%Answer:  I would say that bicycles enjoy a moderate amount of popularity in my hometown.When I was a kid, it was used a lot, and I've seen a lot of people use bicycles to get where they need to go.In point of fact, at that time, the majority of people commuted to and from their workplaces by bicycle.However, the prevalence of bicycles has decreased as motorized vehicles have grown in popularity.However, the fact that so many young people are now riding bicycles is a positive sign.
%%How frequently do you ride a bicycle?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Sincerely, I hardly ever ride a bicycle these days.We are compelled to use a bicycle less frequently due to our busy lifestyle, the increased speed of motorized vehicles, and our lack of interest in physical activity.I occasionally ride a bicycle, but not for travel but rather for fun.Because the car is faster and more comfortable to ride in, I prefer to use it more often than a bicycle.
%%Q.Do you believe bicycles are appropriate for people of all ages? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Bikes are, in fact, suitable for people of all ages, in my opinion.Bicycles are good for our health and the environment, are inexpensive, and require almost no upkeep.Children, adolescents, and senior citizens alike can ride it without difficulty due to its low physical exertion.People of all ages should consider riding a bicycle as their primary mode of transportation because of the unparalleled health benefits it offers.
%%When compared to a car, what are bicycle's advantages?Why?]
%%Answer:  Except for the fact that cars are faster, bicycles offer far more advantages than cars.The fact that riding a bicycle keeps us healthy is the primary benefit.Bicycles are good for the environment and don't pollute the air.They are inexpensive and do not require costly services or maintenance.Bicycles do not require larger parking spaces, whereas cars do.Bicycles could be a great alternative to motorized vehicles in our community, especially when considering the negative effects on the environment.

%%Gift-giving as a subject:
%%Q: When do people in your nation give gifts or presents?
%%Answer:  In my nation, we typically give gifts to others on special occasions like birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries.During the Christmas season, many people follow the tradition of exchanging gifts.On the days of a teacher's departure, we frequently purchase them presents.
%%In addition, whenever we visit our relatives' homes, we frequently send flowers and candy to their children.
%%When you visit someone's home, do you ever bring a present?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Yes, I typically purchase gifts for such occasions.I do it because it is a popular tradition in our country and because I like the idea of giving gifts to hosts, especially when they love them.In addition, it is a nice gesture as a guest and a token of appreciation.
%%Q: When was the last time you received a gift? [[What was that?]
%%Answer:  That's a fascinating question, and it brings to mind a present I received from a close friend just a few weeks ago.Maria went to Italy in November to see her grandparents. When she got back, she gave me an Italian perfume.She gave me expensive Gucci Premiere Eau De Parfum, which I really appreciate.
%%Q: Do you enjoy looking for people's gifts? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Yes, I absolutely adore perusing various shops to find the ideal present for a loved one.It may take some time to locate a suitable gift idea and purchase the item, but it demonstrates our love and care for the recipient.If the present is liked by the person, the time we spend looking for it is well worth it.
%%Games as a %%Topic:
%%Q: Which games are popular in your nation?Why?]

%%Answer:  Yes, the majority of the time I enjoy playing badminton.My favorite sport was and is football, but I can't find time in the evening to practice.Chess is one of my favorite pastimes, and I frequently visit a few of my friends who share my enthusiasm for the game.A single chess match between me and my friend can sometimes take multiple days to complete!
%%In your country, how do people learn to play games?
%%Answer:  The majority of people in my country, I believe, learn to play various games as children, and their families, classmates, and friends play an important role in teaching them.Young children frequently play games and imitate elders that are common in their community.
%%People who are serious about sports or want to be professional athletes frequently get into various training facilities to improve their skills.

%%Telephone Techniques:
%%Q: How frequently do you call people?[Why or why not?

%%I make or receive calls, send or receive text messages, and occasionally use the internet with my mobile phone.I enjoy listening to my favorite music and playing games on my phone frequently.I rarely miss a day without using it.
%%Q.Who do you talk to the most frequently over the phone?Why?]
%%Answer:  That would be my mother, I believe.She starts to worry if I do not contact her for more than a few hours because she is so close to me.When I'm out, she calls me a few times a day, and I can tell her almost anything.She is the person with whom I spend the most time on the phone or mobile phone because of these reasons.
%%When do you anticipate calling me again in the future?Why?]
%%Answer:  After I leave the exam room, I will contact my mother to inform her that I am fine and that my exam went very well.I'll call her because I'm sure she's eager to hear from me and find out how well I did on the exam.
%%Do you occasionally prefer to communicate via text message rather than telephone?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Yes, there are times when texting rather than calling someone is more practical and convenient.For instance, I would prefer SMS over phone calls when I am in a meeting or in a crowded location.In addition, if I need to send an email address, phone number, or text message, I would rather text than call the intended recipient.
%%Topic: Your pals:
%%Q: Would you rather have a single friend or a group of friends?Why?]
%%Answer:  It seems like a difficult question to answer.However, I'll try.Naturally, I would like to have friends from my neighborhood, school, and online, but my best friend would be someone truly special.One particular friend, who I believe would be an excellent friend and completely trustworthy, is difficult to find; however, unlike many other friends, he or she will remain my friend for a considerable amount of time.
%%Q: With your friends, what do you enjoy doing most?
%%Answer:  I enjoy spending time with my friends and having conversations with them.With them, I frequently engage in indoor and outdoor games.We can be completely ourselves with our friends because we can practically say and do anything with them.I sometimes prefer to travel with friends to different cities, and a few months ago, I went to Milan with two of my closest friends.
%%Q: Do you think it's important to keep in touch with your childhood friends? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Friends from my childhood are, in a way, special to me.During this stage of life, we make friends without expecting anything in return.Additionally, our childhood friends are a part of these cherished memories, which are truly priceless.Therefore, keeping in touch with those friends is essential.In any case, according to a functional perspective, having ordinary contact with all cherished companions is beyond the realm of possibilities as we lose contacts with a significant number of them as we become older.
%%Q: What characteristics define a good friend?
%%Answer:  I think it takes time, shared interests, and similar mentality to strengthen friendships.As they demonstrate through their activities that we can trust them and share anything with them, many of our friends become close friends.

%%The Musical Instruments %%Topic:
%%Q.Which instrument is your favorite to listen to?Why?]
%%Answer:  I prefer the sound of a piano the most.A piano's notes are so delightful and melodious.It calms my mind and soothes my ears.The guitar is widely used with the majority of musical genres, making it possibly my second favorite instrument.
%%Q: Have you ever taken lessons to play an instrument? [Which is it?]
%%Answer:  I once tried to learn how to play the guitar well.Even though I was accepted to a music school to learn to play the guitar, I was unable to complete the course.Although I can play some basic guitar tones and music, I am not a skilled guitarist.
%%Q: Do you believe that school should teach children how to play a musical instrument?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Students who are interested in learning to sing or play a musical instrument should have access to a facility in schools, but not everyone should be required to do so.A child at school should have the option to learn it if they are passionate about it.
%%Q: If you didn't have a teacher, how easy would it be to learn to play an instrument?Why?]
%%Answer:  In the days before the internet, I believe it was nearly impossible.However, today's interactive video tutorials and online courses make it a little bit easier to learn to play a musical instrument like a drum or guitar without a mentor.Having a teacher, on the other hand, is extremely beneficial because they encourage students to learn and can serve as a model for mastering musical instrument skills.
%%Topic: Place of residence:
%%Q: Where do you call home?
%%Answer:  I live in (explain the name of your region) in (explain the name of your city or town).Since it is our permanent home, I have been living there ever since I can remember.
%%Q: What kind of location is that?
%%Answer:  More than 2 million people live in this large town.The town is beautiful, and the locals are friendly and helpful.My neighborhood, which is north of the town center and is beautiful because of its peaceful setting and friendly neighbors, is located there.
%%Q: What area of your town or village is most interesting?
%%Answer:  Actually, I can recall a number of interesting aspects and facts about our town, the most interesting of which is that the entire town is an island.Our town can only be reached by ferry, launch, or bus over a bridge.The fact that the city generates all of its own electricity is probably the second most fascinating aspect of the city.If I were to describe the most fascinating part of our town, it would be the north, which serves as the center.
%%Q: What kinds of occupations do residents of your town or village hold?
%%Answer:  That would be difficult to answer due to the wide range of occupations in our community.However, I believe that the list would be dominated by fishermen, IT professionals, construction engineers, and salespeople.In our town, many young people operate online businesses, and a few wealthy individuals own hotel chains.Many locals are indirectly involved in the hotel and tourism industries because it is a popular tourist destination.
%%Q: Do you think it would be a good place to live?why?)
%%Answer:  People always prefer to live in a great neighborhood where everyone is nice and there is peace and quiet.In this way, our town is a wonderful place to live.Because it is an island, you can get fresh fish and vegetables, and our food is great if you like seafood.Last but not least, people frequently relocate to our town for the availability of employment opportunities.I am pleased to call this town home.
%%Topic: Adaptation:
%%Q: Could you describe the kind of place you live in?
%%Answer:  My family and I share a twenty-five hundred square foot apartment in which we all live.There are four bedrooms, a guest room, and a large dining area in our fourth-floor apartment.We have a nice view from our apartment, and the building is close to the city center.
%%Q: How many years have you been there?
%%Answer:  Since my father bought this apartment almost three years ago, we have lived there.Before that, we lived in a rented apartment in the same neighborhood.
%%Q: What makes you enjoy living there?
%%Answer:  We are content with the apartment we live in, and the best thing about it is that it has a great view of the lake.We love the fresh air and can walk by the lake in the morning and evening because the building is next to a beautiful lake.I also like the area because it has almost all of the modern conveniences we need nearby.
%%Q: Which kind of housing would you prefer to live in the most?
%%Answer:  To be honest, I would rather live in a house than an apartment.However, owning or renting a house in the city center is practically impossible due to rising housing and accommodation needs.Therefore, we are content with our apartment at the moment.However, if I had to choose, I would move to a town and own a large house with a stunning lawn in front.
%%Topic:Color %%Q: Which color is your favorite? [Why?]
%%Answer:  Pink is my favorite color, and I imagine that many other girls share my fascination with this hue.Pink is a delicate color that signifies sweetness, sweetness, playfulness, cuteness, romance, charm, femininity, and tenderness.The universal love for oneself and others is symbolized by the color pink.More than any other color, I adore it.
Alternate Response:Blue, the color of the sky and the ocean, is my favorite color.Wisdom, trust, confidence, intelligence, faith, and heaven are all represented by this color, which is associated with stability and depth.I had always preferred blue jeans and was drawn to this color since I was a child.Blue is a color that I like, which may be one of the reasons why I like it so much.
%%Q: Do you still enjoy wearing the same colors as when you were younger? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  It's true that pink has always been my favorite color.When I was just 4 years old, my father gave me a lovely pink doll, and my parents painted my room pink when I was a kid.I have fallen in love with this color ever since, and it is interesting that it has not changed.
Alternate Response:Up until the time I turned 19, my favorite colors were red and white.Oddly, I began understanding the significance of blue tone when I began voyaging broadly.After watching the movie "Blue," I did a lot of research on this color.In addition, my weakness for blue jeans was made worse by my fascination with them.
%%Q: What can a person's favorite colors tell you about them?
%%Answer:  My opinion is that a person's choice of colors frequently reveals a great deal about themselves.For instance, people who favor black are frequently artistic and sensitive, while green-loving people frequently exhibit affection, loyalty, and candor.Although these are undoubtedly generic descriptions, they provide a clue for evaluating the various personality types that are present within a group.In a more scientific sense, a person's preference for a color can be used to speculate on their life experiences and preferences.
%%Q.In your culture, do any colors hold special significance?
%%Answer:  In our culture, white is associated with peace and red with violence.Interestingly, contrary to its earlier meaning, red is sometimes referred to as the color of friendship and sacrifice!Green, as far as I know, is associated with prosperity and nature in our country, whereas yellow is associated with happiness and sunshine.Last but not least, black is associated with the gloomy and sad past of history.However, some people in our country frequently venerate black as the color of intelligence and the mystical world.
%%Topic:Flowers Is it a favorite of yours to have flowers in your home?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  This is a fascinating inquiry, and I would be delighted to respond.In point of fact, whenever a special occasion occurs at our house, we purchase flowers and consider them an essential component of the occasion.We buy a variety of flowers for occasions like birthdays and marriage anniversaries, for example, and we love having them in our home.Blossoms are invigorating and upgrade the allure of the festival.
%%Q: If you wanted to buy flowers, where would you go?Why?]
%%Answer:  I go to a nearby floral shop that sells a wide range of flowers and flower bouquets if I need to buy some common varieties.It delivers fresh flowers to your home.However, if I need to purchase a rare flower, such as a night lily or chocolate cosmos, I order them from a large online store that specializes in creating bouquets for a variety of occasions and offers a wide selection of flowers.
%%Q: When would you typically present someone with flowers?
%%Answer:  In our nation, we can almost always give someone a flower to congratulate them or wish them luck.Aside from that, I can give flowers to anyone at any time for any occasion, so it's possible that it's not best to do so during a sad or mournful event.
%%Q: Do flowers play a significant role in your culture? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Flowers hold a significant place in our culture.They stand for innocence, happiness, selflessness, good fortune, and purity.Many people offer flowers to the deity they pray to, while others find them to be a source of beauty and freshness and give them to loved ones.


%%Topic: Neighbours
%%Q.How well do you know the people who live next door to you?
%%Answer:   I know my neighbours very well. Mr and Mrs Patrick, who live adjacent to my house, are more than our neighbours and in fact, they are like close friends. Mr Albert, who lives across our house, is a great person and I often visit him to play chess with him. I have a few neighbours who are close family friends. Thus some of my neighbours are intimate and dear to us and we have a great relationship.
%%Q.How often do you see them? [Why/Why not?]
%%Answer:   I see them almost every day. Every time I go out, I see someone waving his hands at me and I do the same whenever I see them. Besides, some of our neighbours who walk in the park in the morning often exchange greetings with me. In terms of visiting each other, we go to their house, and they also visit us quite frequently - I would say at last once a week. Since our neighbours live close to us, we see them more frequently and have more conversations with them than our relatives.
%%Q.What kinds of problem do people sometimes have with their neighbours?
%%Answer:   I believe the dispute with the fence and boundaries is a common issue among neighbours and that could be sometimes the reason for their animosity. Besides, lack of mutual respects, irrational behaviour, letting pets run wildly could be a few other reasons people do not have a healthy relationship with their neighbours. Sometimes jealousy can crack their bond as well.
%%Q.How do you think neighbours can help each other?
%%Answer:   Neighbours are often more important than relatives in the sense that our neighbours would be on our side whenever we need their help and they share our happiness and sorrows alike. Thus a good neighbour can be helpful in a tremendous way by extending his or her supporting hands in times of distress and discomfort. They look after our property when we are away and can also become our good friends over time. To cite an example, when my grandfather became severely ill all of a sudden in the middle of a night almost six months ago, my neighbours came to our help and we could have been in great turmoil without their prompt support and assistance. Thus good neighbours are a blessing for us.
%%Topic: Your favourite place
%%Q.What place do you most like to visit? [Why?]
%%Answer:   The place, I like to visit the most, is called the “White Cliffs of Dover” in Kent. I like to visit this stunning coastline, which has been saying ‘hello’ and ‘farewell' to thousands of people crossing the English Channel for centuries because of its gorgeous geology with dazzling white chalk faces, sharp edges rising 350 feet above the sea level along with the layers of wild and lush grasses.
%%Q.How often do you visit this place? [Why?]
%%Answer:   I like to visit this place, one of the most famous landmarks in the UK, if not the most, twice a year because visiting beautiful places is one of the few things that I really enjoy out of my very busy work life, and White Cliffs of Dover seems to top the list of those places which helps me relax the most because of its stunning natural beauty.
%%Q.Why do you like it so much?
%%Answer:   I like visiting this place so much because of its unique feature. In fact, there are very few places on this earth where one can see such a long stretch of coastline which is completely made of white chalks. I like it also because this place, standing tall as the guardians of the island, has witnessed many historical events such as the unsuccessful Roman invasion of Julius Caesar and being on the frontline of the First World War and the Second World War.
%%Q.Is it popular with many other people? [Why?]
%%Answer:   Yes, it is popular with many other people because of Dover Castle the largest castle in the UK, and the Bronze Age boat apart from the stunning looking White Cliffs are the centre of attractions to many visiting tourists. In fact, in the past few years, an average of 3.4 million people chose Dover for a day trip, and of them, over 500,000 people chose to stay there overnight.
%%Q.Has it changed very much since you first went there? [In what way?]
%%Answer:   Yes, it has changed since I visited this place last time as people can enjoy an annual plant fair event now where beautiful flower plants, as well as vegetable plants, are displayed for the public view. Besides, the number of visitors had also significantly increased since I visited there last time.
%%Topic: Leisure
%%Q.Do you have any hobbies or interests? [What are they?] 
%%Answer:   I have a number of hobbies such as watching movies, gardening and reading story books. While I enjoy having all of those hobbies, depending on my location, mood and weather condition, the most special one to me is “reading storybooks”.
%%Q.How did you become interested in (whatever hobby/ interest the candidate mentions)?
%%Answer:   I became interested in some hobbies since my early high school days. In fact, my school would declare nice “awards” for the best storytellers in order to encourage students like me to take part in the storytelling competition from our favourite storybooks. I became interested in “gardening” rather recently after learning how we could stop the greenhouse effects by planting more trees. As for watching movies, I became interested in it as long as I remember. This is entertaining, educational and one of the most popular hobbies in our country.
%%Q.What is there to do in your free time in (candidate’s hometown/village)?
%%Answer:   During free time, where I live in Dubai, one can visit the Dubai Coffee Museum in the Al Fahidi neighbourhood in order to enjoy some of the best coffee in the world but also to learn about the history of coffee as well as the history related artefacts. Besides, one can also enjoy public sandy beaches in Dubai during his/her free time.
%%Q.How do you usually spend your holidays?
%%Answer:   I usually spend my holidays by visiting my parents and relatives who are living outside of Dubai. I also like to take my family to one of my favourite restaurants in order to enjoy some of my favourite dishes. And finally, sometimes I enjoy sports competitions on TV on holidays. 
%%Q.Is there anywhere you would particularly like to visit? [Why?]
%%Answer:   Yes, I would like to visit many places in the world, given that I have enough money and time. But one place, which I would really like to visit, is “Niagra Falls” in Canada, and the reason is obvious. I want to visit it because it is a geographical wonder and one of the most famous waterfalls in the world.
%%Topic: Television
%%Q.How often do you watch television? [Why/Why not?]
%%Answer:   I am studying to pursue a post-graduation degree at one of the leading Engineering universities in China, and I also work at a shopping mall after my school hours until 9:00 pm. By the time, I arrive home after finishing everything, either it is a bit too late to do anything, or I am just exhausted. Therefore, I don’t really get to watch TV often unless there is a valid reason to do so.
%%Q.Which television channel do you usually watch? [Why?]
%%Answer:   As I have mentioned earlier, I don’t really have much time to watch TV, but when I do get some time and opportunity, I like to watch “Discovery” and “AXN Asia”. I watch Discovery mainly because it allows me to learn about some of the most amazing and coolest things in the world, and I like watching AXN because it helps me to improve my English by offering subtitles for the contents the channel shows.
%%Q.Do you enjoy the advertisements on television? [Why/Why not?]
%%Answer:   I don’t exactly enjoy watching advertisements on television simply because I think of them as a waste of time. Besides, I also think that most advertisements have poor contents and try to deceive prospective customers into buying something that they don’t need.
%%Q.Do you think most programmes on television are good? [Why/Why not?]
%%Answer:   Well, it depends on what kinds of programmes I am watching.  However, having said that, I would say that many programs on television are not good because they offer a few educational perspectives. Even the news shows these days are not “objective” enough to offer the values of “news” and therefore, are not trustworthy. 


%%Topic:Question from Neighbors: How well do you know your neighbors?
%%Answer:  I really know my neighbors.Mr. and Mrs. Patrick, who live next to my house, are more than just neighbors; in fact, they are friends in a way.I frequently visit Mr. Albert, who lives across the street from our house and is a wonderful person. We play chess together.A few of my neighbors are friends from my family.As a result, some of my neighbors and I have a close and meaningful relationship.
How frequently do you see them?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  They appear almost daily to me.I do the same whenever I see someone waving their hands at me whenever I go outside.In addition, I frequently greet some of our neighbors who walk in the park in the morning.We visit each other at their home, and they also visit us quite frequently, at most once per week, I would say.We see our neighbors more frequently and have more conversations with them than with our relatives because they live nearby.
%%Q: What kinds of conflicts do individuals occasionally have with their neighbors?
%%Answer:  I think that disagreements over the fence and boundaries are a common problem among neighbors, which may sometimes be the cause of their animosity.In addition, people may not have a healthy relationship with their neighbors for a number of other reasons, such as a lack of respect for one another, irrational behavior, and allowing pets to run wild.Their bond can sometimes be broken by jealousy as well.
%%Q: How do you believe neighbors can assist one another?
%%Answer:  In the sense that our neighbors would be by our side whenever we needed their assistance and that they share both our joys and sorrows, neighbors are frequently considered to be more significant than relatives.As a result, when someone is in need of support or assistance, a good neighbor can be of tremendous assistance.They take care of our property while we are away and may eventually become good friends.For instance, my neighbors came to our aid when my grandfather suddenly fell ill in the middle of the night almost six months ago. Without their prompt support and assistance, we could have been in a lot of trouble.Therefore, having good neighbors is beneficial to us.
%%Topic:Your number one spot
%%Q.What spot do you generally prefer to visit? [Why?]
%%Answer:  The Kent location known as the "White Cliffs of Dover" is my favorite place to visit.I enjoy going to this stunning coastline, which has been greeting and saying goodbye to thousands of people crossing the English Channel for centuries due to its stunning geology, which includes layers of wild and lush grasses and dazzling white chalk faces.
%%Q: How frequently do you visit this location?Why?]
%%Answer:  One of the few things I really enjoy doing outside of my very busy work life is going to beautiful places, and White Cliffs of Dover seems to be at the top of the list of places that help me relax the most because of its stunning natural beauty. I like to visit this place twice a year because it is one of the most famous landmarks in the UK, if not the most famous.
%%Q.What makes it so appealing to you?
%%Answer:  Because of its singular feature, I love going here so much.In point of fact, there are very few places on the planet with such a long coastline that is entirely made of white chalks.As the island's guardians, this location has witnessed numerous historical events, including the unsuccessful Roman invasion of Julius Caesar and being on the front lines of the First and Second World Wars.
%%Q.Does it appeal to a lot of other people? [Why?]
%%Answer:  Yes, Dover Castle, the largest castle in the UK, and the Bronze Age boat, in addition to the stunning White Cliffs, are the main attractions for many tourists who come to visit.In point of fact, over the course of the past few years, an average of 3.4 million people have selected Dover as a destination for a day trip, of which over 500,000 have chosen to spend the night there.
%%Q.Has it changed significantly since your first visit? [How exactly?]
%%Answer:  Yes, things have changed since I last visited this location. Now, there is an annual plant fair where beautiful vegetable and flower plants can be seen by the public.In addition, the number of visitors had significantly increased since my previous visit.
%%Topic:Leisure Question: Do you have any interests or hobbies? [How do they work?]
%%Answer:  I enjoy gardening, reading story books, and watching movies among other things.While I enjoy all of those activities, the one that holds the most special significance to me depends on my location, mood, and the weather.
%%Q.How did you get interested in (the candidate's hobby or interest)?
%%Answer:  Since the beginning of high school, I've been interested in a few hobbies.In fact, my school would give nice "awards" to the best storytellers to encourage other students like me to participate in the competition where we tell stories from our favorite books.After learning that planting more trees could prevent greenhouse effects, I became interested in "gardening."Since I can remember, I've had an interest in watching movies.This is entertaining, educational, and one of our nation's most popular pastimes.
%%Q: In your spare time, what can you do in (candidate's hometown or village)?
%%Answer:  Where I live in Dubai, one can visit the Dubai Coffee Museum in the Al Fahidi neighborhood during free time to not only sample some of the world's best coffee but also learn about the history of coffee and see artifacts related to it.In addition, Dubai offers free public sandy beaches for visitors to enjoy.
%%Q: What are your typical holiday activities?
%%Answer:  During the holidays, I typically visit my relatives and parents who live outside of Dubai.In addition, one of my favorite things to do is take my family to one of my favorite restaurants to try some of my favorite dishes.Lastly, I occasionally enjoy watching sporting events on vacation on television.
%%Q: Is there a location in particular you would like to visit? [Why?]
%%Answer:  Yes, with enough time and money, I would like to visit many places around the world.But "Niagra Falls" in Canada is one place I really want to go to, and the reason is clear.I want to go there because it is one of the most well-known waterfalls in the world and a geographical wonder.
%%Topic:Television: How frequently do you watch TV? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  I work at a shopping mall after school hours until 9:00 p.m. in addition to studying for a postgraduate degree at one of China's leading engineering universities.I'm either too tired to do anything when I get home after finishing everything, or it's a little too late.As a result, I rarely get to watch television unless I have a good reason to.
%%Q: What channel of television do you typically watch?Why?]
%%Answer:  As I mentioned earlier, I don't really have much time to watch television, but when I do, I enjoy watching "Discovery" and "AXN Asia."I enjoy watching AXN because it provides subtitles for the content it shows, which helps me improve my English. Discovery is my favorite channel because it lets me learn about some of the most amazing and cool things in the world.
Do you enjoy watching television commercials?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  I find television advertisements to be a waste of time, so I don't particularly enjoy watching them.In addition, I believe that the majority of advertisements attempt to deceive potential customers into purchasing unnecessary goods with poor content.
%%Q: Do you think most television shows are good? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Well, it depends on what I'm watching at the time.Having said that, I would still say that many television programs are bad because they provide a few educational perspectives.Nowadays, even news programs aren't "objective" enough to provide the values of "news," so they can't be trusted.

%%Topic:Entertainment Question: Do you like to unwind at home or go out in the evening more?Why?]
%%Answer:  In most cases, I like to go outside at night.Instead of staying at home, I believe that the evening is a good time to meet friends outside and exercise.I've been doing this for a very long time, and if I stay at home at night, I get bored.
What do you enjoy doing when you go out for the evening?
%%Answer:  I prefer to go for evening walks or hang out with my friends the most.I frequently ride my bicycle for about an hour once or twice a week.I enjoy going to the movies with my friends on occasion.
%%Q: How well-liked is this among other people in your nation?
%%Answer:  People in my country regularly engage in outdoor activities like riding a bicycle, hanging out with friends, and walking in a park.These are often done in the afternoon by many adults and children.In the evening, families frequently go to the theater to spend quality time together.
%%Q: Is there anything you don't like to do for entertainment? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  I guess it irks me to see people wasting away for extended periods of time in front of a television.I do think that television is a great way to get news and watch entertaining shows, but some people are addicted to it and watch television almost six to eight hours a day.I just don't like this because I think I could use this time better.
%%Topic:Magazines and Newspapers %%Q.Which newspapers and magazines do you read?Why?]
%%Answer:  Every day, I read the Indian Express, a daily newspaper, and "The Week" is the magazine I like to read the most.When I get the chance, I enjoy reading newspapers and magazines to stay up to date on what's going on in my region and the rest of the world.I like perusing the magazine since I get to find out about the different subjects of my advantage.%%Q: What kinds of articles pique your interest the most?Why?]
%%Answer:  I read health-related articles because I am interested in learning important advice on how to maintain both physical and mental health.Since I am a computer science student, I am also interested in learning about the most recent trends in computer technologies. As a result, I never like to miss any technology-related articles.However, this does not necessarily imply that I do not enjoy reading other kinds of articles, such as those that discuss food and sports.
%%Q: Have you ever read a magazine or newspaper in another language?When/Why?]
%%Answer:  I've always wanted to read and talk to people in languages other than Hindi and English.However, I've discovered that it's not exactly simple.But I know a little bit of "Bengali," the language of Bangladesh, a neighboring country of India, which has helped me read and comprehend some "Bengali" texts in recent newspapers.After meeting a Bangladeshi girl who is now one of my best friends, I started reading Bengali newspapers.
%%Q.Do you believe that reading a newspaper or magazine in a foreign language is an effective method for learning the language?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Naturally, reading a newspaper or magazine in a foreign language is a great way to learn the language because it allows us to comprehend the language's texts and their meanings at our own pace and at a time that works best for us.In fact, English is also a foreign language to me; I've learned it by listening to English on radio and television and reading English newspapers and journals.
%%Topic:Countryside %%Q: Could you please tell me your full name?
%%Answer:  Sure!Hoang Pham is my full name.My nickname is "Hoang."
%%Q.What name should I give you?
%%Answer:  Please refer to me as "Hoang."I'm grateful.
%%Q: Please describe the countryside surrounding your city or town.
%%Answer:  My home is in Hanoi, my nation's bustling capital.However, our countryside, which is at least 60-70 kilometers outside of my city, is tranquil and surrounded by an amazingly energizing landscape.You will also be able to see shades of green that cover the landscape to the horizon, making it impossible to leave!
%%Q: In the future, do you prefer to live in a big city or the country?Why?]
%%Answer:  I would like to live in the countryside in the future primarily because I adore nature and prefer to remain close to her.In addition, I am convinced that living in the country is better for my health than living in the city because I would be able to drink clean, pure water and inhale clean air.Lastly, I adore the straightforward lifestyles of rural residents.
%%Q.For what reason really do certain individuals move to a city from a provincial region?Do you know anyone who has done this?
%%Answer:  I would venture to guess that some people relocate from a rural area to a city primarily for the better income opportunities it provides.In addition, there are some individuals who would relocate to a city to take advantage of the "flashy" city life.Finally, there are some individuals who would relocate to a city for better educational opportunities.One of my distant cousins, for instance, moved to Hanoi a few years ago to attend a reputable technical university.
%%Q.Do you appreciate visiting enormous urban communities or little towns? [Why?]
%%Answer:  In my country, small villages don't have traffic issues, so I always enjoy visiting them rather than big cities.In addition, people in small villages tend to be much friendlier and simpler than those in large cities.Last but not least, I do enjoy going to my country's villages, no matter how big or small, because they are so beautiful and have clear lakes and natural greenery.
%%Topic:Questioning: What sorts of things make you laugh?
%%Answer:  I also agree that laughter is an effective treatment.So, whether my friend is making fun of me or I'm watching a comedy movie with my friends, I like to laugh.But my pet cat's funny antics are what really make me laugh the most.In point of fact, my cat does so many "funny" things to make me laugh that I even take video of them.
Are you good at making people laugh?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Well, that depends on how well I know them and what kind of circumstances are in place.However, in principle, I don't really like to make people laugh because I wouldn't really know what they've been going through or what kind of mood they really are in, and sometimes the funny act might actually make them angry.
%%Q.Do you believe individuals must chuckle? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Yes, I do think it's important for people to laugh whenever they get the chance because laughing almost always helps us get rid of stress and tension in our bodies and minds.Laughter can also temporarily alleviate pain and contribute to a greater sense of well-being as a whole.Lastly, laughing is important because it makes us all feel better about ourselves and our lives and brings us closer together.
%%Q: Do you believe that laughing makes you happy? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  I do think that when we are happy, we like to laugh, and that is a universally acknowledged expression of who we are as humans.
However, this does not imply that laughing makes one happy.In fact, people can laugh and cheer others up even when they are sad or in pain.Additionally, there are a lot of people in this world for whom laughing is merely an "expression."For instance, we may laugh at a "party" or other social gathering in order to simply follow the "flow," but this does not necessarily imply that we are content.

%%Topic:Cooking and food %%Q.What kinds of foods do you enjoy eating?
%%Answer:  I enjoy eating almost any kind of food, whether it's European, American, or Asian.But because I'm an "Aussie," I prefer meat or fish more than anything else, no matter what I'm served.However, the chicken parmigiana, a traditional Australian dish, and the burger with "the lot," which contains a lot of "goodies," are my two absolute favorites.
%%Q: Which novel dish would you like to try?Why?]
%%Answer:  I've heard a lot about Indian cuisine, and I'd really like to try some of it because, according to what I've heard, it's not as fattening as other foods.Furthermore, I might want to attempt them additionally on the grounds that they taste great in light of involving various types of flavors in amazing mix, and the dish I might truly want to attempt is "palak chicken curry" made with spinach and chicken.
Do you enjoy cooking?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  I consider cooking to be an excellent pastime, and I do enjoy cooking from time to time because it enables me to prepare my favorite dishes exactly how I like them!In addition, I enjoy cooking for the creative and "fun and play" opportunities it provides through chopping, stirring, and tasting.Last but not least, I enjoy cooking because it gives me a chance to show how much I care about my family.
%%Q: What was the most recent dish you prepared?
%%Answer:  A chicken parmigiana, one of my favorite dishes, was the last meal I prepared about a week ago.I did, of course, take some time to prepare the food, but at the end of the day, it tasted and felt just right.
%%Q: Do you prefer restaurant fare or home-cooked fare?Why?]
%%Answer:  Although I occasionally enjoy dining out, I always prefer to prepare my own meals because they tend to be healthier and contain more nutrients and less fat.Additionally, dining out can be costly.Last but not least, sharing a home-cooked meal with family members while laughing and conversing with them is far superior to eating in the company of strangers.
%%Topic:%%Q: What would you like to alter about your daily routine?
%%Answer:  After returning from work, watching too much television has become part of my daily routine for the past few months, and I would really like to change that.Not only does my wife not like this awful routine, but I also don't like it a lot because I don't get enough sleep at night because of this extra habit/routine of watching television.
Are all of your days the same for you?
%%Answer:  No, just like a day in the winter and a day in the summer are not the same, so are all of my days.As a consequence of this, I experience periods of "not-so" happiness while remaining happy on other days.In addition, there are days when I am extremely productive at work and other days when all I want is to be more "productive."
%%Q: Describe your typical weekday and weekend schedule.
%%Answer:  Paying a small "tribute" to my "Goddess" mother at the beginning of each weekday is something I do every day, whether it's a weekday or a weekend.Then, after having breakfast and a shower, I rode my motorcycle to work, where I arrived around 9 a.m.After I finish my work around 6 p.m., I go to a local market to buy some fresh groceries and fish and meat.When I get home, it's almost eight o'clock in the evening.After finishing my meal, I immediately start watching television, which I do until I go to bed after midnight most days.Except for the fact that I don't go to work on weekends, my weekends are pretty much the same as my weekdays.Naturally, I do occasionally take my family and wife to a nearby park or restaurant on the weekend to spend quality time together.
%%Q: In your typical day, how do you find time for leisure, study, and work?
%%Answer:  I like to think that my work life and free time for leisure and other activities are fairly balanced during a typical day because I almost always have enough time after work hours to spend with my family and attend other important activities like grocery shopping and temple worship.
%%Topic:How do you typically travel to work or college? [Travel to work or college]Why?]
%%Answer:  Since I live in a remote village without a reliable public transportation system for getting to and from work, I typically commute to work on my motorbike.In addition, I like my small motorcycle because it is easy to use and easy to park anywhere.
%%Q.Have you always traveled the same way to work or school? [[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Yes, I have always traveled to work on my bike, primarily because I find it very convenient to be able to travel wherever I want at my own pace.In addition, I have discovered that riding my bike costs significantly less than taking a public bus, which is not very reliable due to poorly constructed roads in my neighborhood.
%%Q: What do you enjoy most about traveling this way to work or school?
%%Answer:  The best thing about traveling on a small motorcycle is that I can get to my destination quickly, something I certainly wouldn't be able to do if I took the bus.In addition, after finishing my office work, I sometimes have to go to different places, like to visit my relatives or go grocery shopping, and if I didn't have my bike with me, it would be really hard for me to get there on time.
%%Q.What changes could further develop the manner in which you travel to work/school? [Why?]
%%Answer:  Regarding modifications, I would definitely like to see a significantly improved public transportation system in my neighborhood because riding a motorcycle to work can sometimes be extremely challenging and risky during rainy weather.In addition, since they haven't been fixed or rebuilt in a long time, the roads in my area need to be rebuilt.
%%Topic:Weather that is cold %%Q.Have you ever been in extremely cold weather?When?]
%%Answer:  The monsoon season has a strong influence on the climate where I live in the southern region of Bhutan that borders India.However, when I visited the northern part of Bhutan, which borders Tibet, when I was about 10 years old, almost 20 years ago, to live with my paternal aunt, I did experience periods of extremely cold weather.Naturally, I adored the snow there, but it was far too cold for me, likely due to my upbringing in a different climate.
%%Q: How frequently does it get cold where you live?
%%Answer:  From mid-November to February, the climate in my home country of Bhutan is typically cold, sometimes lasting into March.However, our winters can be extremely dry, with temperatures ranging anywhere from 10 to 25 degrees Celsius.
%%Q: Are certain regions of your nation colder than others? [Why?]
%%Answer:  Despite its relatively small size, Bhutan's temperatures can vary significantly from north to south and valley to valley, depending on elevation.Due to its relatively low altitude, the western, eastern, and central regions of Bhutan (cities like Ha, Paro, Thimphu, Wandue, Tongsa, Bumthang, Trashi Yangtse, and Lhuntse) typically experience European-like weather from November to March, whereas the northern part of Bhutan, which borders Tibbet, can experience extreme cold and snow.
%%Q: Would you rather live somewhere warm or somewhere cold?Why?]
%%Answer:  Even in the summer, I sometimes feel cold (probably due to my low body temperature, I suppose).Therefore, for me, the warmer the weather, the better.In addition, I believe it is a terrible waste of time to put on too many clothes each time I go out and then take them off when I get home.However, I could also be wrong about this "whole practice" of dressing!
%%Topic:Keeping in touch %%Q.How do you typically communicate with your friends? [Why?]
%%Answer:  When my friends are far away from me, I usually contact them by phone or email because it is easier and more convenient than meeting them in person.On the other hand, I always try to meet my friends in person if they live close to where I live because doing so helps strengthen friendships.
%%Q: Do you prefer to communicate with various individuals in various ways? [Why?]
%%Answer:  No, I do not attempt to contact various individuals in various ways.Calling people on their phones is my preferred method of communication with friends, family, or relatives because it enables me to convey my feelings and message in a more direct and efficient manner.Naturally, if there is no phone number listed for contact, and if someone prefers that I contact them via email for more formal reasons, I am fine with using email.
%%Q: Is it easy for you to keep in touch with your loved ones?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  Certainly, it is now much, much simpler to communicate with loved ones now that mobile phones and the internet have become widely available.Because we are able to not only talk with them but also “view” them simultaneously on our phones or computers, regardless of whether they live next door or in another part of the world, contacting friends and family has actually become much more personal in recent years as well.
%%Q: Did people in your country in the past communicate in the same way they do today?[Why or why not?
%%Answer:  No, people in my nation did not exactly communicate with one another in the same way they do today.In point of fact, prior to the advent of smartphones and the internet, people communicated with one another via landlines and postal mail.In addition, in the past, individuals utilized the "telegram" whenever they needed to get in touch with other people quickly.

%%Topic:Visitors' Questions: What should a visitor to your nation see and do?
%%Answer:  There are simply too many things to do in Bhutan, which is a stunning country.In addition to the Himalaya, this country in the Himalayas has some of the world's most stunning and, of course, tallest mountain ranges.Beautiful forests and ancient Buddhist temples can also be seen.
The Tiger's Nest Monastery (Paro Taktsang), which is unquestionably one of Bhutan's most iconic landmarks and is situated at the side of a steep cliff wall in the Paro valley, is one of the many things that almost everyone wants to do when they arrive in the country.However, if you are really interested in learning about the festivals celebrated by the Bhutanese, you can always attend some religious festivals—known as "Tsechus"—from close quarters in addition to meeting the locals and sampling their customary fare.
%%Q: Do you have any recommendations for traditional music or arts?
%%Answer:  Buddhism is deeply ingrained in the arts, culture, traditions, and music of Bhutan.When it comes to music, I would suggest Zhungdra and Boedra, which are folk songs (traditional music).Extended vocal tones and a relatively straightforward instrumental melody are used to sing Zhungdra.Additionally, I would recommend the "Cham" dance, which involves performing a series of masked dances while dressed in vibrant costumes for religious festivals.
%%Q.Describe the kinds of visitors and tourists from abroad who visit your nation.
%%Answer:  The majority of tourists who visit Bhutan for short periods of time are nationals of Asian nations, followed by Europeans and Americans.Since tourism began in 1974, the number of people visiting this Himalayan nation has only increased, reaching 260,000 in 2018.
%%Q.In what ways has your nation been altered by tourism?
%%Answer:  Bhutan has benefited greatly from tourism.Nowadays, it is common to see teenagers smoking cigarettes in jeans and hooded sweatshirts instead of the traditional Gho, a knee-length robe, due to tourism.Better roads, the requirement of English instruction for schoolchildren, and the introduction of the television network and Internet service are all outcomes of tourism in Bhutan.
%%Topic:Traveling %%Q.How did you get to the testing location?
%%Answer:  The testing center is a long way from where I live.As a result, I had to take a bus to get to the testing center by road.
Do you like to travel?
%%Answer:  Yes, I enjoy going on vacation whenever I can to see what my nation and the rest of the world have to offer.I have traveled outside of my country to India, Nepal, Turkey, Malaysia, and Bangladesh thus far.
%%Q: How typically do you travel?
%%Answer:  Unless I'm going to my place of employment, in which case I take my motorcycle, I usually travel by bus on the road.Naturally, I travel by plane when I travel to a foreign country.
%%Q: In your country, which modes of transportation are utilized the most frequently on the streets?
%%Answer:  Public buses and taxis are the most common modes of transportation in my country.The government is planning to expand our water transportation system, in addition to our railway system.
%%Q: What kinds of modes of transportation do people in your nation typically use to move around?
%%Answer:  The majority of people move around in four-wheel-drive pickup trucks and public buses.While wealthy individuals drive their own cars, the majority of them ride their own bicycles and motorbikes.

      %%Q.Describe something you have lost recently (ielts-mentor.com).
        %%You ought to say: %%%%• what you lost, how you lost it, how important it was to you, and how you found it.
       %% [You will be required to discuss the subject for one to two minutes.You will have one minute to prepare your response.If you want, you can make some notes to help you.]
       %%Model Response:
       %% According to psychologists, the joy we experience when we earn or locate something of comparable value or price is more harrowing and depressing than the loss of something.I just read this, but when I lost a book I had received as a gift from a dear friend, I realized everything I had read.I'll tell you about this story.
        %%The "Complete Collection Of Fyodor Dostoevsky" was the title of the book I lost.After finishing my first year at the university a few months ago, I went on a trip to Portugal and met a friend from school who had moved to Portugal with her family many years ago.My friend Emily gave me a rare collection of this book just before the day I planned to return to my homeland, and I had some of the best vacation time of my life there.She explained to me that it was a present for my birthday, which was three months away.Furthermore, also, it is a valuable present and I loved her concept of buying this book for me.
     %%I deeply appreciated her thoughtful gift idea and was astonished by her generous gift idea.The only reason I kept the book in my handbag was so that I could read it on the way back.I believe I dropped it somewhere at the airport, which indicates that I was very careless in not properly maintaining it.I searched my bag for the book and, to my greatest horror, could not locate it anywhere.I looked through my bag and found nothing!What a sad time it was!
       %% A dear friend gave me the book as a gift, and she spent a lot of money to buy me one of the rarest editions.Losing it was, to put it mildly, a depressing experience because it was a very significant present for me.
      %%  Because I wasn't sure where I had dropped the book, I had no idea how to get it back.It's possible that I left it in the taxi I took to the airport, one of the coffee shops, or somewhere else at the airport.Thus, aside from sending an email to the air terminal, I had not many choices.
      %%Q.Give an example of a time when you were worried about something.
        %%You ought to say:
         %%%%• when it happened;  %%%%• what you were afraid of;  %%%%• the reason for your fear; and  %%%%• how you felt about it.
      %%  [You will be required to discuss the subject for one to two minutes.You will have one minute to prepare your response.If you want, you can make some notes to help you.]
       %%Model Response:
     %%I believe that being afraid of something is a natural human response to avoiding danger.We are afraid of a variety of things, just like our ancestors were in the beginning, or even when we thought we had conquered the darkness and were safe from imminent danger.But we humans are always afraid of the unknown, just like I was during the strict and unprecedented lockdown period when Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic, along with billions of other people around the world.
       %% The lockdown, which was similar to a curfew, was imposed throughout the nation in March 2020 to stop the spread of the Coronavirus, which was causing so many deaths worldwide.
       %% Despite the changing circumstances and our perceptions of new normalcy, the first two weeks were manageable.But after a few weeks, when the number of positive tests skyrocketed and the number of deaths continued to rise, I felt very afraid and intimidated.The news that some of the neighbors had contracted this virus, which can be cured but can also kill, made the situation even worse.The psychological strain was just too much for me to bear, and I started to panic.
     %%I was worried about the unpredictability of the situation, my parents, who were both over 60, the possibility of being contacted and infected with the Coronavirus, and the increasing financial stress.This was probably the only time in my life when I felt completely helpless and trapped for so many weeks with nothing I could do.It was the kind of circumstance that can only be compared to our worst nightmares.
      %%Q.Describe a time when you were presented with a surprise present.

       %% [You will be required to discuss the subject for one to two minutes.You will have one minute to prepare your response.You can make a few notes to help you on the off chance that you wish.]
       %%Model Response:
     %%I've always liked getting presents, and I still do.I know that I will receive gifts on occasion, like birthdays, but on rare occasions, I am completely unaware of what I will receive.I appreciate you bringing up this subject because it brings back memories of a time when I received an unexpectedly long-awaited present.It took me by surprise because it happened when I was only 10 years old, and I was thrilled that my brain has stored it in special memory cells!
       %% When I was about nine years old, almost every one of my playmates owned a bicycle.I could ride a bicycle and enjoyed it a lot, but I didn't have one.I asked my parents to buy me a beautiful bicycle, but they showed little interest.As a result, when I turned 10 years old, I gradually gave up on ever owning a bicycle.
       %% Then one morning, I discovered a beautiful bicycle at our house and was informed by my mother that it belonged to me!I couldn't believe everything I saw and heard!However, that was it!I was officially the owner of a gorgeous bicycle of the most recent model.
        %%That bicycle was purchased for me by my father.Later, I found out that my parents waited until I was at least 10 years old to get my own bicycle because they were a little too concerned about my safety.
       %% Because I had no idea that my parents would eventually agree to buy me a bicycle, this was a completely unexpected present.Because they wanted to surprise me, they never even mentioned their plan to me in advance.In addition, it came as a surprise because I was given a bicycle just when I had given up hope of getting one.
       %%Q.Give an example of a time when you promised someone something.

       %%Model Response:
     %%If you make any promises, you should keep them.Since I began to understand its gravity, the fear of breaking promises frequently prevents me from ever fulfilling them.However, there are still instances when I did make vows, only to discover later to my dismay that I had failed to keep them all!I'd like to talk about a promise I made to myself that I also broke just a few weeks later for this topic.
     %%I had just graduated from college in 2018 and was looking for work.I felt an invisible pressure on my shoulder as a result of the transition from my relatively relaxed student life to the pressure to find a job, my financial situation, and my substantial debt.In addition, my mood was significantly impacted by a shift in the weather and a pattern of sleep disruption.Contrary to my usual behavior, I found myself in a situation where I quickly lost my cool.In point of fact, I was well-known for my calm demeanor.
      %%  So, one day, after losing my cool, becoming irate for no apparent reason, and shouting at a taxi driver, whom I thought was arguing unnecessarily, I realized that I had changed in a way that I had not anticipated and that I did not like at all.I promised myself on that very day that I would behave more prudently and never allow my temper to control me.
     %%I made this promise to myself because I've never liked people who are irritable and have no good reason to be angry.I've always thought that these people could do better if they were a little wiser and less bitter.Naturally, I didn't want to fall into that category.
     %%I felt great when I made the promise.It was like I could re-create myself and get rid of something bad from my life.However, it was just as disappointing when I broke my promise when I became enraged with my younger sister a few weeks later.It's a good thing that I constantly remind myself that I need to keep my promises, and even if I break them once or twice, there's no reason why I shouldn't try harder. Some people say promises are made to be broken.


      %%Q.Describe a website from which you purchased something.
        %%You ought to say:
      %%  what the website is about, what you bought from it, how satisfied you were with what you bought, and what you liked or didn't like about using it.
       %% [You will be required to discuss the subject for one to two minutes.You will have one minute to prepare your response.If you want, you can make some notes to help you.]
       %%Model Response:
      %%  There are, without a doubt, a lot of sophisticated eCommerce websites on the internet; however, selecting one can be difficult because we won't know for sure if they are really that reliable or trustworthy, unless, of course, we are talking about Amazon.com.
      %%  Now, I believe that very few people who buy things online are unaware of the Amazon eCommerce website.However, to reiterate, it is the world's largest online retailer, manufacturer of electronic book readers, and web service provider that has established itself as the global standard for electronic commerce.
       %% Amazon.com, which was established in 1994, has effectively revolutionized the way online business is conducted by incorporating the most recent technologies to the fullest extent possible on its website.Furthermore, I understood this, once more, when I went to purchase a digital book peruser from their site around a couple of months prior for my 14 years of age cousin.
      %%  Moreover, the electronic book reader I purchased is the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, which is probably the best option for all users.Even though this sharp 6-inch device has 8 GB of storage and a 300-PPI backlit display, it didn't even cost me much.Because I didn't have to look anywhere else for what I was specifically looking for, it was, in the end, quite a deal for me.The best part, though, was that I probably only needed 5 to 7 minutes to finish finding my e-book reader and paying for it.
      %%  The fact that Amazon.com actually lets customers personalize and filter product information based on their taste and preferences was the feature that most impressed me about the website.In addition, the organization of the website's navigational features impressed me greatly.It was built in a way that is easy to understand—especially for such a "gigantic" online retailer—that makes it easy for customers to find what they're looking for.
      %%Q.Give an example of a volunteer experience you've had.
        %%You ought to say:

       %%Model Response:
      %%  When I was in high school, I participated in a variety of volunteer activities from time to time. Today, I'd like to talk about one of those experiences.I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to speak on this fascinating subject.
       %% Regardless, the volunteer work I want to discuss here was aimed at assisting needy and poor children at our city's children's hospital.
       %% Prior to that, I had participated in other volunteer activities, such as preparing soup for our town's elderly and poor and donating old books to local libraries. However, up until that point, I had no idea how to assist children.As a result, we had no idea what we were going to do with the oranges when our school supervisor asked us to buy some from the local market.
       %% Naturally, some of us had guessed that we were going to give those oranges to the plight of the hospital patients, but when we were told to make juice from them, we stopped trying to guess.However, within a short period of time, it became abundantly clear to us that we would use the proceeds from the sale of orange juice to acquire some truly exquisite presents for the children.
       %% At the time, I decided to volunteer because I was getting really bored with my studies and some hard homework, and volunteering was the perfect way to get away from them.In addition, volunteering gave me the perfect opportunity to assist the less fortunate, which is something I enjoy doing.Regardless, I was ecstatic to have the chance to participate in that volunteer work, primarily because it allowed me to witness priceless smiles on the faces of some innocent children.In addition, it gave me the chance to laugh and have fun with my friends while attempting to do a good deed for the people in my community, particularly children my age.I just felt wonderful.
      %%Q.Give an example of a time when you used the internet to solve a problem.

       %% [You will be required to discuss the subject for one to two minutes.You will have one minute to prepare your response.If you want, you can make some notes to help you.]
       %%Model Response:
      %%  I'll start by talking about a time when the internet helped me solve a problem. I'm grateful for this interesting cue card topic.
      %%  I went to a city about which I had very little knowledge to visit my one and only aunt a few years ago.Since this was only my second trip to the city, this was the case.I first went there almost seven or eight years ago, when things looked a little different in that big, crowded city.For instance, numerous new shops and buildings were constructed and the streets became wider.
      %%  In addition, I had no idea that some of the shops and businesses relocated to new locations.Obviously, unless my aunt had asked me to buy her medication from a particular pharmacy, none of these would be a problem for me.She used an inhaler of a particular foreign brand, which was only available at a specific city pharmacy, and she had asthma.Since my previous visit, when I came to visit my aunt, I had assumed that I knew where the pharmacy was.
      %%  However, when I actually went there, I discovered that the pharmacy had relocated.Sadly, no one could tell me about it after I asked a few people there.Even though I was a little skeptic about it, I made the decision to use the internet on my smartphone because there were no other options.Fortunately, however, the pharmacy did provide me with its address and directions as soon as I searched for it using its name on my phone.
      %%  In any case, once I discovered where the pharmacy was, I let out a sigh of relief.After all, I didn't want my aunt to be harmed because I couldn't find a pharmacy where she could get her medicine.In addition, since I had access to the internet, I was able to roam the city with a little bit more courage and self-assurance.
      %%Q.Describe an enjoyable weekend that you still remember.
        %%You ought to say:
         %%%%• when it happened;  %%%%• what you did over the weekend;  %%%%• how much you enjoyed it; and  %%%%• justification for why you still remember it.
       %% [You will be required to discuss the subject for one to two minutes.You will have one minute to prepare your response.If you want, you can make some notes to help you.]
       %%Model Response:
       %% Weekends are typically reserved for fun and relaxation.Unfortunately, however, my weekends are not exactly like this because I frequently have to work on weekends as well.However, I was blessed with a rare free weekend a few months ago, which I thoroughly enjoyed.
       %% However, before I tell you exactly what I did that weekend or how much I enjoyed it, let me first explain how I was able to get that free weekend despite being scheduled to work that weekend.But things started to get a little more interesting when one of my coworkers called me the evening before the weekend to tell me he was going to fill in for me that weekend.He simply replied that it would give him the chance to avoid his "mother-in-law," who was coming to visit his wife that weekend, when I asked him why he wanted to work for me that weekend.Obviously, when I heard the reason from my coworker, I didn't say a word because I also know how difficult the "mother-in-laws" can be at times!
       %% Regardless, I did everything in my power to enjoy the weekend, including spending time with relatives I hadn't seen in a long time.I also spent time with my family watching some of my old favorites.Aside from that, I went shopping for some fashionable clothing for myself for the entire afternoon.I had a wonderful weekend all in all.
       %% I'll always remember this weekend, mainly because it gave me a chance to spend some quality time with my family and friends in a very relaxing mood, something that only happens to me occasionally.It also allowed me to do things outside without feeling the stress of work for a very long time, which is another reason I remember it.

       %%Q.Give an example of a person or thing that makes a lot of noise.

%%Model Response:
%%I'm not sure if living close to the main road has any benefits, but there is definitely one major drawback: having to deal with a lot of noise on a regular basis.So, I guess I'll continue today and talk about the traffic noise on the road close to where I live.
%%In any case, I surmise that in this day and age, there aren't an excessive number of individuals who have barely any familiarity with traffic commotion, particularly, assuming they live in the urban communities.In addition, we are all aware of how congested the city streets and roads can become, with hundreds of vehicles traveling on them each minute and making noises that are nearly unbearable.The tires' traction on the road, loud engine and transmission noises, aerodynamic noises (sounds caused by air movement and vibration), horns, and braking components are the primary sources of these noises.However, it has been discovered that, out of all the noises, the most significant source of traffic noise is the sound of tires rolling from large vehicles like buses and trucks driving on uneven pavement. This noise is amplified as vehicle speeds increase.
%%These traffic sounds are bad enough to make it hard to sleep, give you headaches, make you tired, raise your blood pressure, stress, and make you more likely to get heart disease.Regardless, the noise from the traffic is usually distracting and confusing, making it unpleasant and inconvenient.However, despite the fact that traffic noises are unpleasant and inconvenient, we are unable to completely eliminate them because they are the sound of motion energy generated by the fuel and engine, without which no vehicles could operate.What do I think of it?To be honest, I have a lot of negative feelings about the noise from the traffic, but the most frustrating thing about the noise from the traffic is that I don't feel like I can do anything about it. This is because I think it's a fact of life that we will have to deal with as long as we live in a city.Even more frustrating for me is the fact that despite our collective knowledge of the detrimental effects of traffic noise on our health, almost nothing is being done about it.
%%Q.Describe a time when you worked as part of a team.

%%Model Response:
%%%%I've always thought of myself as a good team player because I've played a variety of roles on various teams in the past.I'd like to talk about my time working on one of those teams today.
%%%%When I was a student at my high school and a member of the debate team, I had this experience as a team member.Moreover, that debate team included three other high school students in addition to me.We were all aware of our roles and responsibilities as a team, so we were able to develop a good rapport even though we were not all the same age.In addition, we were all aware of our individual contributions to the debate's strengths and weaknesses.
%%%%Regarding my roles on the team, my primary responsibility was to take down the opposition debate team's most crucial and significant points so that I could refute their arguments.In addition, I was tasked with providing a summary of the case for my team by listing a number of the most significant points made by each member, including my own and my captain's.Last but not least, it was my duty to assist my team captain in locating the objectionable or contentious facts of the opposition debate team so that he could sequence the facts of our team to support the debate's theme.
%%%%Well, being on that debate team has helped me a lot in my professional life because it has helped me stay calm and confident in difficult situations.In addition, it has taught me how to distinguish fact from fiction without bias.Naturally, being on the debate team has also helped me become a reasonably self-assured public speaker.Lastly, being a member of a debate team in the past has taught me how to work well with others in a team environment without imposing my views on them.

%%Model Response:
%%We must travel to various locations due to our numerous requirements.Naturally, not all of those journeys and travels necessitate advance planning.Instead, only important journeys necessitate advance planning, and today I'd like to discuss one such important journey that was postponed despite ample preparation.
%%I had planned to travel to attend one of my nephews' graduation ceremonies a few years ago.Moreover, my nephew and I are very close friends.In point of fact, my nephew decided to major in engineering as a result of my counsel, and he informed me that his graduation ceremony would be incomplete without my presence.As a result, going to that graduation ceremony had a significant emotional impact on me.In addition, I did not want to miss my nephew's once-in-a-lifetime event.
%%As a result, I planned out every detail, including the mode of transportation I would use and the time I would need to reach my destination.However, despite my meticulous preparations, uncontrollable occurrences prevented me from reaching my destination on time.In fact, I was unable to get a taxi on time, which caused the journey to be delayed.Additionally, I needed to visit a close friend who had been injured in a terrible accident on the same day, so I was unable to catch a taxi on time.Despite the fact that my friend escaped injury in the crash, my journey was delayed.
%%Obviously, I was somewhat disappointed when my journey was delayed.However, knowing that there was a valid reason for the delay gave me a sense of relief even though it was delayed.Because of the same reason, I also thought that my nephew wouldn't mind that brief delay.In addition, I was confident that I would still be able to attend at least a portion of the graduation ceremony if I attempted to reach my destination via alternative means.
%%Q.Describe a place you've been that was packed.

%%Model Response:
%%I live in a nation that is one of the largest in the world and has a fairly even population distribution in major cities and towns.As a result, I rarely encounter crowding in most of the places I visit.But a few months ago, I went to the largest stadium in our city to watch a football game. There were thousands of people there, and I felt like I had never seen so many people in one place before.
%%I made the decision to watch the semifinals of a major football competition in our nation, which took place in November, with two of my friends.We went to the stadium three hours before the game as planned, and we were surprised to see a line at the ticket counter and a wave of people.In the line, we had to move around like ants, and I believe it took us over an hour just to get into the stadium because of the crowd and long line.
%%When I entered the stadium, I was even more surprised because I could see people of all ages all around me.Although the crowd was friendly, it was too much for me.Because of the noise all around us, we had to shout to communicate with one another.I was glad to be there, and the semifinal was a very exciting affair that kept me entertained and guessing until the very end.
%%Q.Give an example of a time when you were forced to wait a long time for someone or something.

%%[You will be required to discuss the subject for one to two minutes.You will have one minute to prepare your response.If you want, you can make some notes to help you.]
%%Model Response:
%%I try to be patient as often as I can, even when I have no reason or incentive to wait, because it is said that patience is a great virtue.But, for better or worse, waiting for something or someone is a fact of life. We have to wait, even if we don't like it. I didn't like it when one of my coworkers made me wait for a long time for no good reason.This took place at my workplace about a few months ago.I was naturally a little excited to leave my workplace as soon as possible and enjoy the weekend because it was Friday.However, just an hour before our office closed, one of my coworkers suddenly jumped in front of me and asked me to lend him my motorcycle.He informed me that he had to leave for some urgent reasons and would return shortly before the office closed.So, I gave my coworker the key to my motorcycle in good faith, only to discover that he couldn't properly value my good faith.
%%In point of fact, he arrived after a number of hours rather than an hour.Regardless, I tried to remain composed when he returned and inquired about the real reason for his lengthy delay.He responded by stating that he had been to the hospital to see a friend but had become stuck there.Additionally, he sincerely apologized for the delay.
%%In any case, I naturally felt a little frustrated and even irritated at my coworker's irresponsible behavior after waiting for such a long time, especially considering that I planned to leave my workplace as soon as possible.But when I found out that he went to the hospital to see his friend, I felt like I had lost a lot of valuable time working for a good cause—helping someone in a time of need.

%%Model Response:
%%I have always regarded the chance to work in a different nation as a rare privilege, regardless of the nation.However, if I ever had to choose a country to work in, "Japan" would unquestionably be my first choice.
%%I have thought and learned that Japan is a great place to look for work opportunities ever since I started university. There are many reasons for this.However, before I proceed to discuss the reasons I want to work there, I would like to briefly introduce this wonderful nation.
%%Japan is the fourth largest island nation in the world. It is located in East Asia and has more than 6850 islands in the Pacific Ocean.Japan, also known as "Nippon" or "Land of the Rising Sun," is one of the world's most industrialized countries and the second largest "developed economy."Moreover, Japan ranks among the world's most technologically advanced nations.
%%Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that opportunities for employment in the service, mining, construction, manufacturing, or manufacturing sectors are virtually limitless in Japan.However, I would like to work in the information technology (IT) industry because the demand for IT professionals has increased dramatically in this great nation over the past few decades.In fact, I've even learned how Japanese businesses try to hire foreign workers to meet demand.Therefore, if I ever have the chance to work in Japan, I would like to do so for at least three years.
%%Regardless, I'd like to work in Japan because the workplace culture there is excellent and everyone treats each other with respect.In addition, if I were to return to work in my own nation, working in a country like Japan would provide me with valuable work experience that I could use to advance my career.Last but not least, I'd like to work in this wonderful nation because of the extremely high salary structure.
%%Q.Give an account of your ideal vacation spot.

[You will be required to discuss the subject for one to two minutes.You will have one minute to prepare your response.If you want, you can make some notes to help you.]
%%Model Response:
%%It would be nearly impossible for me to pick one ideal vacation spot and then describe it because I have so many ideas in my head.Nevertheless, I would nonetheless proceed and make every effort to comprehend my ideal vacation spot.
%%To begin, my ideal vacation spot would be on an island far from civilization and surrounded by a cool, calm ocean.Naturally, when I say my ideal vacation spot would be far from civilization, I am not necessarily implying that it would be far from the airport.I would always be able to taste some fresh fruits when I was hungry because the island would be covered in a wide variety of fruit trees and other beautiful forests and landscapes.My ideal vacation spot should have neither too much heat nor too little cold.My ideal vacation spot should not have any tall buildings or hotels covering the sky, so I can actually see the moon and sky at night. It should also have sandy beaches that look beautiful.
%%Also, I wouldn't want my ideal vacation spot to be too quiet or too crowded and busy because doing so would detract from the fun of meeting people from different countries and cultures.My ideal vacation spot wouldn't be complete without a few hills and mountains perched on the shores of the ocean.Lastly, in my ideal vacation spot, the hotels should be plain and not too tall, and they should be close to the sand so that I can sit on their balconies and get a perfect view of the ocean.
%%Therefore, it would be the ideal location for my next vacation, primarily because it would enable me to forget about the concerns and negative aspects of my everyday life.In addition, it would give me a chance to learn about, comprehend, and appreciate people from other nations, cultures, and backgrounds in a way that I would not be able to do otherwise.Last but not least, it would keep me close to the beautiful natural surroundings, which would also help to rejuvenate my body and mind.

    description: `
 %%The third part is more abstract.
%%This is your chance to really refine your responses and talk about the issues the examiner brought up.For four to five minutes, the subject will be linked to what you talked about in Part 2.
 %%Some examples of responses %%Topic:Family.
%%Q.1:In your nation, how important is family?
%%Answer:  I appreciate your question.In my nation, people prioritize their family above all else because they hold the belief that family comes first.They would do anything for the family, and I am proud of the strong family ties that exist in my country.
%%Q.2:In your nation, how has the size of the family changed over the past few decades?
%%Answer:  I know from personal experience that my grandfather was part of an extended family, and that people at the time used to live with close relatives.According to what I've heard, their ancestors also came from a joint family with sometimes more than twenty members.However, in cities where the majority of families are nuclear, the trend toward living with extended families has dramatically changed.The number of large families living together in my country's villages is still decreasing.
%%Q.3:What changes do you anticipate for the family in the future?
%%Answer:  I think that more people will have a nuclear family in the future, and that the size of the family will be smaller.Nowadays, people prefer not to have more than two children, and who knows when they might even consider a one-child policy.The very standard that a man gets hitched to a lady and have their own kids to shape a family is being tested by the idea of same-sex marriage and this pattern will increment later on.%%Q.4:In your nation, what role do grandparents play in the family?
%%Answer:  Grandparents are like the pillars of virtue in a family and play a crucial role.They teach how to stick to one's roots and help the family find balance by upholding the family's cherished customs and values.With the rising number of both working guardians, grandparents frequently care for the kids.Because they have more experience, they frequently offer advice to the rest of the family on family matters. As a result, their advice frequently prevents us from making poor decisions.In this way, they act like trustworthy mentors.%%Q.5:Do you think the family or the government should be in charge of taking care of the elderly?
%%Answer:  I think it is most important for the family to care for and personally support older members of the family, just like they did when they were younger.These elderly people have made a lot of sacrifices throughout their lives in order to start a family and then make their children happy.The younger members ought to do everything in their power to accompany their elders and supply them with the things they require.
However, government also has some responsibilities.Since these senior citizens were once taxpayers, the state ought to provide them with healthcare, entertainment, and other services.%%Q.6:Why is there a decline in the number of joint families in modern times?
%%Answer:  The city-centric, highly competitive, and busy lifestyle, in my opinion, has diminished the concept of a joint family and created the nuclear family.In addition to the influence of the city and ever-increasing inflation, our preference for a materialistic lifestyle and disinclination toward traditions and values have resulted in the formation of our own nuclear family.
%%Topic:Choosing work and balancing work and life.
%%Q.1.In your nation, what kinds of jobs do young people not want?
%%Answer:  As a result, there aren't many jobs that young people in my country don't want to do because we've almost always had a big problem with unemployment.However, I have discovered that jobs like "outside sales," "medical representatives," and other "service-oriented" ones that require longer hours are not well-liked by young adults in my country.They dislike the "elementary teaching" job as well because it requires a lot of patience (since teaching young children can be extremely challenging).
%%Q.2.Who does a better job of guiding adolescent job seekers:parents or teachers?
%%Answer:  Teachers, in my humble opinion, are the best people to help young people choose a job because they typically put in a lot of effort at schools and colleges to help young adults realize their full potential.In addition, teachers are in a better position to identify the young people's skills and expertise by constantly interacting with them in class, allowing them to help them choose careers that are right for them.
%%Q.3.Is cash generally the main thing while picking a task?
%%Answer:  No, I don't really think that money is the most important factor when choosing a job because money doesn't always buy happiness or job satisfaction, no matter how much of it we have. "Always" is the keyword here.In addition, despite my best efforts, I may not be able to perform to my full potential if I am paid a lot of "money" but the "job" I do is not regarded as "important."Money is important for us to have a job, but I don't think it's the most important part of having a job.
%%Q.4.Do you agree that a lot of people in today's society are under pressure to work longer hours and take fewer vacations?
%%Answer:  Yes, a lot of people are under a lot of pressure right now to work longer hours and take fewer vacations because most of them are having trouble keeping up with the rising cost of living.Then, because they are being “exploited” by their employers, some people are also under pressure to work longer hours.Another group of people, on the other hand, is under pressure to work longer hours in order to satisfy an increased demand for additional life comforts and luxuries.
%%Q.5.What impact does a lack of work-life balance have on society?
%%Answer:  There are many different ways that people's lack of work-life balance affects society.People won't be able to take on enough responsibility in a society where people either work too much or sit around for too long to achieve their full potential.People in a society would experience mental depression if they worked too much and didn't have enough time to relax with their families and friends. This would lead to less efficiency and productivity at work.On the other hand, crimes and other forms of anti-social behavior would have a negative impact on the entire society if individuals in that society were to "sit idle" for an excessive amount of time.
%%Q.6.Could you give us some good ideas for how governments and businesses can help people find a good balance between work and life?
%%Answer:  There are a number of things that employers and governments can do to help employees find a good work-life balance.First, whenever possible, employers can provide employees with "flexibility" in their work schedules so that they have little time to spend with their families and friends between shifts.Employers can also give their employees "unpaid time off" so that they can go to fun family events. Unpaid time off means that employees don't get paid for those days off.Regarding the governments, they can raise public awareness of the advantages of a healthy work-life balance by utilizing a variety of media outlets.Companies and employers who actively work to promote "work-life balance" among their employees may also be eligible for an "annual award" option provided by governments.
       

%%Topic:Competition and sports.
%%Q.1:Why are some sports enthusiasts so devoted?**
%%Answer:  I think that sports are more popular with some people than other forms of entertainment and competition, and they always watch their favorite sports on television.Their favorite pastime is sports, and many of those ardent fans were once players themselves and played the game when they were young.When a goal is scored or a game is won, their family, friends, and the city go wild as they grow up.Therefore, it is natural to follow other people's enthusiasm and support local teams.Their enthusiasm for sports often grows as a result of this attachment.Many young people in my country are ardent football fans, and they have their favorite teams.They take every opportunity to show their support for their favorite team when they play, sometimes even going to the stadium to do so.Youths adore and enthusiastically follow their favorite athletes because they are idolized by them.
%%Q.2:In your nation, is there any violence at sporting events?**
%%Answer:  In general, such violence is extremely uncommon in my nation.However, fan disagreements are quite common, and they tend to be verbal rather than physical.They frequently use blogs and social networking sites to criticize their rivals.However, I do recall a very unfortunate incident that occurred probably three or four years ago. Fans of two opposing teams became enraged, resulting in three fatalities and numerous critically injured injuries.In order to deal with such unforeseen occurrences, the stadium's security has been revamped, with the hope that they will not occur again.
%%Q.3.Should athletes serve as better examples?**
%%Answer:  The majority of fans, in my opinion, begin to adore an athlete or sportsman when they witness a spectacular performance.As a result, football magicians like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have millions of fans, many of whom began idolizing them without knowing them personally.However, when these young people begin to follow their favorite athletes or sportsmen, they occasionally follow them blindly.Because of this, famous athletes should always strive to live exemplary lives so that thousands of others can follow in their footsteps.They are also well-known, and the media keeps a close eye on them.They should try to be better role models for young people because it is a social and moral responsibility for any celebrity to behave in a way that does not damage their fame.
%%Q.4.What are the advantages of international sporting events?**
%%Answer:  Nations come together as a result of international sporting events, reducing tension and animosity.People love these kinds of events, and they can be a great reason to enjoy the competition in the stadium.As a result, competitions of this kind help local businesses thrive and attract tourists.Occasionally, prestigious events like these inspire young children all over the world to participate in sports.This is beneficial for globalizing the essence of sports, which, in my opinion, have an impact on society on all fronts—economic, political, and cultural.
%%Q.5.Is it significant for a country to win bunches of decorations?**
%%Answer:  I think that every nation wants to win as many medals as they can because it shows how good it is at sports and athletics.Being at the highest point of the medallist is much of the time thought about an extraordinary accomplishment yet I for one accept that it isn't really essential.For many small nations, participating in international sporting events like the Olympics frequently serves as motivation.For them, a few medals can frequently be gratifying and motivating.In an international sporting competition, the ability to perform and enjoy oneself is more important than the number of medals won.For the sake of preserving peace and harmony around the world, athletes and sportsmen from all over the world gather at a single platform to represent not only their own nation but also humanity as a whole.
%%Q.6.Compared to other professionals, professional sportsmen make significantly more money.Is it necessary?
%%Answer:  The majority of sports celebrities, in my opinion, do not make much money, while a select few are extremely fortunate.The earnings, in my opinion, are justifiable in light of the training, dedication, challenges, and sacrifices they make throughout their lives.We need to keep in mind that their career is brief and that they earn a lot of money because they do a great job.The celebrities get paid a lot because people buy tickets to their shows and different businesses want them to be brand ambassadors, which makes them millions of dollars a day.I don't see any problem if they make a lot of money because these payments are legitimate and transparent.
%%Topic:Historic location
%%Q.1:How really do individuals in your nation feel about safeguarding noteworthy structures?
%%Answer:  With the possible exception of a few individuals who place business ahead of morality and logic, I believe people in my country would want to safeguard and preserve significant historic structures.In the past, there were times when people spontaneously opposed the plan to demolish such sites.Because of an enormous public kickback and objection, the authority had been compelled to leave their arrangement to fabricate multi-celebrated business structures by crushing the old structures that have verifiable importance.As a result, citizens in my nation are concerned about safeguarding historical significance.
%%Q.2:Do you think that having a fascinating historical site nearby can help a region?Which way?
%%Answer:  There is no doubt that a location with a fascinating historical landmark can benefit from a variety of perspectives.To begin, such a location would support the expansion of numerous local businesses and draw a large number of tourists.Additionally, the local government is able to attract additional development projects to these areas because of their strategic significance.In order to shield these regions from natural disasters, the government takes additional precautions, attracting more attention.In addition, the region's flourishing tourism brings the customs and traditions of the area to other parts of the country.As a result, this region develops more quickly than other areas.
%%Q.3.What do you anticipate happening to historic buildings or locations in the future?Why?
%%Answer:  That's hard to say, and everything would depend on the generation to come.The authority would take measures to safeguard such sites and structures if they believe they are worthy of preservation.If not, a lot of them—many of them less well-known around the world—would vanish and be replaced by cutting-edge commercial structures.On the other hand, prominent locations would be preserved due to the large number of international tourists who will visit them.Lack of upkeep will weaken some of them, and in the not-too-distant future, a few new ones will emerge as historic sites and buildings.Because they are less popular and unable to sell tickets to tourists, some historic buildings and locations will be demolished.As a result, the authority or owner wants to use them for business.These historic sites face threats from urbanization, pollution, and the need for more buildings to accommodate the growing population.
%%Q.4:How did you learn about history in school?
%%Answer:  We were fortunate to have a few amazing teachers who explained how history is essential for understanding the future. Our teachers mostly taught us history from textbooks.They frequently explained significant historical events and characters, as well as the ways in which these events and powerful men have influenced future events.We were not required to watch documentaries based on actual historical events, but we were required to read history books.We were able to learn more about history as a result.Two to three times a year, our school authority took us to various museums and historical sites. These excursions gave us opportunities to learn more and view historical artifacts.I can think of a specific time when we were taken to a war museum and told how the wars we despise had such a profound effect on human society.
%%Q.5:Is there a way for people to learn about history outside of school?How?
%%Answer:  The best way to learn more about history, in my opinion, is to read about it and do research on it online.The history we learn in school is only the beginning.We need to read a lot of books to really learn about the past, and the books we choose should be based on the readers' interests.The interactive videos on various websites are truly helpful, and the Intenet is an amazing tool that can assist us in learning about our past.It gives us a chance to learn more about history.Lastly, traveling is a great way to learn about the world we live in and how different civilizations shaped it.A person who travels a lot learns about history more quickly and experiences history rather than assuming it.
%%Q.6:Do you believe that history will continue to be taught in schools in the future?Why?
%%Answer:  History, in my opinion, is more than just a record of past events, civilizations, and influential people.It's a good way to think about the future.As a result, history will become more important in the future, and more students will be interested in learning about it than ever before.History has yet to reach its full potential, and it is still regarded as a subject for weaker students.However, in the not-too-distant future, we will realize how crucial it is for people to learn it for the sake of prosperity.Therefore, I see no reason why history should be dropped from school curricula.


%%Topic:Cinema and films.
%%Q.1:Do you think the number of people going to the movies has gone up or down in recent years?
%%Answer:  Because the response might appear contradictory, that is a somewhat complicated issue.All things considered, I generously accept that more individuals appreciate motion pictures today than any other time in recent memory yet a large portion of them don't head out to a cinema to partake in a film.As a result, movie theaters have lost their luster, particularly in my nation, but an increasing number of people still find time to watch movies on television or on their computers.The days when my parents would occasionally take me to the movies are long gone.We now enjoy more than three to four movies per week but never visit a movie theater.I believe that the reasons for this changing trend are the popularity of international films, low-quality local films, and amenities for a great home movie experience.
%%Q.2:Do you think this pattern will continue in the future?
%%Answer:  The trend will continue in the future unless radical changes are made to movie theaters and restrictions are put on how we stream and watch the latest movies at home.We would be able to watch movies on demand at home thanks to technology, which would further diminish the appeal of movie theaters.However, there are still some people who enjoy going to the movies with friends and family on a day off.
%%Q.3:What are the benefits and drawbacks of making films about actual events?
%%Answer:  I assume that one of the benefits is that those movies already have a plot, that the storylines are well-known, and that the producer is able to easily come up with characters.Due to the historical significance of these films and the favorable reception they receive from audiences and critics, they frequently win awards.
%%However, making movies based on real-life events has some drawbacks.First and foremost, audiences and critics scrutinize such films more closely, and they frequently spark debate.Besides, the story is now known to individuals and the film needs to guarantee more than its storyline.Additionally, making such films requires a significant financial investment, and they frequently perform poorly at the box office.
%%Q.4:How important, in your opinion, do you think it is for a filmmaker to keep telling the same story?
%%Answer:  When making a film based on a real-life event or a prominent historical figure, I believe that accurate historical facts should be preserved, and that every filmmaker should make every effort to adhere to the truth to the greatest extent possible.In any other case, the movie would end up attracting resentment and negative feedback from both general audiences and movie critics.To make a movie more appealing, a filmmaker may need to include some unexpected turns and surprises, but they can always do so without distorting the main facts.It is important to keep in mind that children who watch such films frequently interpret them as reenactments of actual historical events.As a result, these films should not distort history or stoke controversy.
%%Q.5:Should we be able to choose what we watch on television and movies or should they be censored?
%%Answer:  I think the film and television industries need to impose some kind of censorship so that we can watch movies and TV shows without being embarrassed or offended.For instance, my parents would be embarrassed if I started watching a movie with them and there were too many sensual and violent scenes.We should limit the amount of violence, hatred, and offensive scenes shown in movies because they have a significant impact on viewers' minds.However, I am also of the opinion that creative artists ought to be permitted to use these forms of expression to convey their emotions and thoughts.As a result, excessive censorship, which is prevalent in some nations, is also undesirable.Although we adults may frequently choose what we want to watch, we should always keep an eye on what our children are watching for their own benefit.
%%Q.6:In your opinion, how will censorship laws evolve over the next two decades?
%%Answer:  That is a difficult question to answer, but I will nonetheless attempt!Some first-world nations, where censorship laws are too lax, will, in my opinion, amend laws to make them a little more rigid after about two decades.In contrast, developing nations would take the opposite approach and give creative artists more freedom.In my opinion, every nation will attempt to strike a balance in their censorship laws to make them more welcoming and helpful to viewers.
%%Topic:Transport and travel.
%%Q.1:How simple is it to travel throughout your nation?
%%Answer:  My country has a lot of public transportation options, like bullet trains, modern buses, and airplanes, so it's easy to get around.Airports in major cities in my nation simplify the lives of commuters.We have eight-lane highways that are regularly maintained, so anyone can drive to get from one area to another without any problems.Additionally, citizens can take long-distance trains to visit other districts and are comparatively less expensive. In addition, metro rails are convenient for city dwellers to commute to and from their workplaces.
%%Q.2:Which mode of transportation do you think is the safest?Why?
%%Answer:  I believe that flying is the safest mode of transportation, despite some common misconceptions.We fly frequently both domestically and internationally, and the service is really good.Many people are killed and injured in aviation accidents, which frequently make headlines and give the impression that flying is harmless.However, air travel is the safest option when causalities are compared to those of road accidents.Because flights are well-organized and air traffic is controlled more effectively by trained professionals, flying is the safest way to travel in my country.
%%Q.3:Is it true that travel is now safer than it was in the past?
%%Answer:  Some would argue that there are more accidents and deaths today than there were in the past.However, I believe that travel in recent years has significantly improved and now provides commuters with greater convenience.In contrast to the past, when we could only hear about major accidents, we now see more accidents because they are all being reported in the news.In recent times, traffic laws have become more stringent, severe safety measures like biometric verification have been implemented, and modern transportation systems have been designed with safety in mind.Terrorist attacks are virtually impossible because of rigid airport regulations.
%%A common train station in my nation has in excess of 15 train timetables and they convey great many travelers every day.There were only three to four trains a day at this station in the past.We would have a true picture of road safety if we compared the number of vehicles and commuters to that of the past. I believe that road safety has improved recently.
%%Q.4:What are the advantages and disadvantages of cheap air travel?
%%Answer:  The significant advantage of modest air travel is that many individuals can bear to visit more places all over the planet and in this way cultivate the travel industry.People who travel more frequently are more tolerant of other cultures and help keep the world at peace.
%%One of the drawbacks is that more flights are causing more pollution in the air.Air travel at a low cost draws more passengers, who in turn inadvertently contribute to air pollution.In addition, minimal expense air tickets don't guarantee positive solace and conveniences which individuals frequently lament.On such a trip, the cost of food and beverages is unjustifiable, and there are frequently additional costs that are not disclosed.
%%Q.5:How do you anticipate people's future travels to be conducted?
%%Answer:  I'll be both imaginative and realistic in my response to that intriguing question.In the near future, I think people will prefer to travel long distances by plane or fast train, and flights will be cheaper to attract more passengers.We would depend more than ever on our automobiles to get around the city because they would be our constant companion.
%%Similar to a sci-fi vehicle, our automobiles would be able to fly short distances and even run on the river in 30 to 40 years.We will have flying cars that will take us to our offices in about 50 years, and software will drive those cars instead of humans.A century from now, individual SkyTran carrier pods will travel via airways rather than roads.We might even be able to teleport directly from our home to our destination after a few centuries, who knows?
%%Q.6:Should a nation's government concentrate more on road or rail transportation?Why?
%%Answer:  The country's geology, existing infrastructure, population, and economic situation, in my opinion, ought to guide the choice.For instance, it is difficult and costly to construct rail tracks in a nation with predominantly hilly roads and rivers.Connecting highways and road transports is more cost-effective and practical for these nations.Additionally, rather than focusing on rails, the nation should prioritize road development and enhancement if it does not already have sufficient rail tracks.Lastly, countries with a greater population should think about building railroads because they can transport a large number of people at once.Therefore, rather than relying solely on a single factor, a decision regarding whether to invest in rail or road transportation should be made.


%%Topic:Universities.
%%Q.1:Is higher education in your country too expensive?
%%Answer:  Higher education is provided for free by government-run universities in my nation.Compared to private universities, this type of university has significantly lower tuition costs.However, the actual number of seats offered by state-run universities and colleges is significantly less than the number of students applying for post-graduation courses.As a result, many students, most of whom come from wealthy families, are accepted into private universities and are required to pay a hefty tuition bill.
%%Q.2:Should the cost of attending college be shared by all students?Why?
%%Answer:  I don't think that students and their parents should be the only ones responsible for paying for the university.State-run universities must provide free education because the government allocates funds for the education sector, the majority of which go toward higher education and research facilities.In addition, the government is obligated to spend taxpayer funds on social welfare, and providing free or inexpensive education should be a top priority.
%%Q.3:What positive effects do universities have on society?Is it similar in your nation?
%%Answer:  Universities are society's beacons, producing educated citizens who will lead the nation.Universities not only educate young people and prepare them for the future, but they also carry out significant research projects that are to the nation's and society's mutual benefit.For instance, numerous medicines and inventions that we are familiar with were actually developed as a result of research and projects carried out at universities.Hence colleges serve both the general public and the country in various ways that have an immediate relationship with the general improvement of a country.It gives me great pride to say that universities in my nation also play a similar role.
%%Q.4:Teaching or research, which is more crucial?Why?
%%Answer:  That seems like a difficult question to answer.Nevertheless, I believe that both are necessary.Research works, on the other hand, assist in the solution of practical issues and contribute to the advancement of the nation. While effective education ensures that young students receive the education they need to prepare for the future, research works do the opposite.Additionally, I believe that more students and teachers should participate in university research projects.
%%Q.5:What should students do during their summer breaks?What did you do with it?
%%Answer:  Long vacations should be used wisely, in my opinion.To get the most out of their summer breaks, students should plan ahead because they have more than two months to enjoy them.They can travel for one to two weeks, participate in a paid job to gain some practical experience, enroll in skill development classes, study subjects they find challenging, and volunteer for their community.
%%Throughout my summer vacations at my college, I have taken three skill development courses, one of which was a language course, traveled extensively, worked a few part-time jobs, read a lot, and visited my grandparents.I intend to enroll in a graphic design program and spend a few weeks in Italy the following year.
%%6:What advantages do private universities have over public ones?
%%Answer:  I can say from personal experience that private universities are more disciplined and frequently update their curriculum to make courses more useful to students.Because the administration at a private university does not permit politics or similar activities, the learning environment there is frequently superior.An added benefit is that many private universities have better labs and research facilities.They assist students in avoiding session jams and launching their careers earlier because they complete the course within the anticipated timeframe.Some of the world's most prestigious private universities include Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and MIT. They have maintained an excellent academic environment and research output, demonstrating that some private universities may indeed be superior to many public universities.
%%Topic:Reading Fiction
%%Q.1:Do you for the most part peruse a ton of books or do you incline toward sitting in front of the television?Why?
%%Answer:  I prefer to read books rather than watch random TV shows.That does not, however, mean that I despise watching television.Reading, in my opinion, is a much better habit than watching television.We can learn something new from every book, and spending time reading a book is more beneficial.The same cannot be said for the television.We frequently watch television to pass the time, but instead of watching something meaningful, we end up scrolling through channels.
%%Q.2:What kinds of books do you think are good to read?
%%Answer:  I think it's a good idea to read books that aren't filled with racist or offensive language and are appropriate for the reader's age.In general, a book is good if it can keep readers interested, provoke thought, or teach them something new.For me, a good book always has a compelling plot and well-developed characters.However, the fact that books are educational and based on actual events is often what draws me to them.
%%Q.3:Do you think people read the same way they did in the past as they do now?
%%Answer:  I think that there have always been readers in our society, and there are still those who enjoy reading books more than anything else.However, reading habits have evolved over time.We can now download and read any book we want using digital devices and the Internet.Despite the fact that young people seem to be more interested in technology than books these days, there are still a lot of readers who use technology to read the works of their favorite authors.Additionally, we can freely discuss a writer and their books on online platforms.
%%Q.4:Do you think famous authors are good people to emulate?
%%Answer:  When we think about famous writers as a whole, they are better examples for us than many politicians, athletes, and celebrities.We should, on the other hand, follow them through their writings, their contributions to society, and their good deeds rather than the few individuals whose personal lives are negative.We have always been inspired in various ways by writers.Therefore, we stand to gain more than we lose if we consider well-known authors to be our models.
%%Q.5:Would you rather read the book or watch the movie if it was based on a book?Why?
%%Answer:  I wouldn't mind seeing the movie as well as reading the book.However, my own experience has taught me that, in most cases, books are superior to movies.Many people find that watching a film is more exciting, and the film's interesting visual effects make it more appealing.Nonetheless, books can contact a peruser more significantly than the film.While movies can bring entire worlds to life before our eyes and make characters come to life, books pique our imaginations and transport us to a world we have never seen before, allowing us to experience each character's experiences and leave a lasting impression on us.As a result, I might not see some good movies based on books, but I wouldn't want to miss those books.
%%Q.6:How does our reading routine change as we get older?Why does this occur?
%%Answer:  We read more as we get older, and our reading habits are primarily driven by our interests rather than academic requirements.We are so young and innocent that a fairy tale can transport us to a wonderful mythological world.We want to be like the hero or heroine who defeats evil with magical abilities.This, on the other hand, is not the case as we get older because as our minds mature, they need more practical things to be challenged and entertained.As a result, as adults, we want to be like a real-life hero who doesn't have a mysterious power but simply has the willpower and determination to overcome obstacles and change the world—or at least the people around him.As we get older, so do our book choices and perspectives on the world around us.

%%Topic:News and media.
%%Q.1:In your country, how do the majority of people get their news?
%%Answer:  I am greatly appreciative of your question.In my country, the majority of adults get their news from newspapers and television.However, many office workers also use online news portals to keep up with the latest news and events.For this kind of information, young people heavily rely on online newspapers and their preferred social networking platform.
%%Q.2:In the future, how do you anticipate people will obtain news?
%%Answer:  I believe that the way news is obtained and shared in the future will be altered by technology.The majority of people will rely on their Internet-connected handheld devices as their primary source of news and information.On the other hand, because of the time lag between when something happens and when readers can read or watch it, traditional newspapers and news channels will become less popular in the future.A powerful means of receiving news updates will be mobile devices, which can provide instant updates.The preferred type of news would be determined by our activities and interests, and the use of small devices that are attached to our ears would become increasingly common.
%%Q.3:Do you put your faith in everything you read in the news?
%%Answer:  No, I don't trust everything that newspapers put out for the general public.I read mainstream newspapers because they have a lot of authority and authenticity.As a result, I avoid reading most of the fabricated and fake news that is typically published in newspapers that are not as trustworthy or authoritative.Additionally, I am wary of politically incorrect and unsourced news articles that are shared on Facebook and Twitter by my friends or their friends.
%%News gathering can sometimes be done hastily and recklessly, resulting in inaccurate information even in mainstream newspapers.I try to verify the news from other trustworthy sources in such instances.In point of fact, fake and made-up news is all around us, and if we aren't careful and experienced, we won't be able to spot lies that aren't obvious.
%%Q.4:How has television affected people's lives?
%%Answer:  The television would be my answer to the question "what is the single most influential invention that has changed people's lifestyle?"In my nation, every household needs to have a television.Many people use it to learn, get information, and have fun.TV is used by people to get news, weather updates, learn about other cultures, relax, and even help them plan their next day.In the morning, evening, and even before going to bed, they watch television.Television shows keep them together in the living room, entertain them, and alleviate the loneliness of many elderly people.Fashion has been influenced by fashion stars, advertising on television has changed people's buying habits, and quiz shows have made many young people more curious.Television, in my opinion, contributes to the bonding of communities and families.
%%However, there are downsides to this device as well.Political propaganda is frequently broadcast on state television channels, and excessive television viewing frequently leads to dangerous illnesses like diabetes and obesity.
%%Q.5:How do you feel about children watching television?
%%Answer:  I believe that children can learn from watching educational, creative, and entertaining television shows.However, parents should keep an eye on their children's TV viewing habits.Children benefit from watching television in some ways because it helps them relax and become more curious.Additionally, some television programs provide children with useful academic information.However, prolonged television viewing by children can cause physical and mental harm.These kids lose interest in outdoor activities and develop an addiction to television and video games.
%%Q.6:How has news consumption and dissemination been affected by social media?
%%Answer:  Social media is a great way to connect people and share information, updates, and news with those we care about.Not only have we been able to read the news, but we have also been able to express our concerns.As a result, it has provided ordinary citizens with a common forum on which to express themselves and their perspectives on the world.It is now easier than ever to obtain and share interesting news.
%%However, it has also become chaotic as a result of people's propensity to share news without verifying its authenticity.For example, half of the news posted on these social media platforms is either fabricated or fake.
%%Topic:Internet.
%%Q.1:In your nation, do the majority of people own a computer at home?Most people use it for what?
%%Answer:  In order to respond to this question, I should first mention that computer ownership is nearly ten times higher in cities than in villages in my nation.Thus, with the exception of the poor, most urban families own at least one computer, while nearly one in twelve rural families own a laptop or computer.
%%The activities performed on a computer vary by age group.For example, kids like to watch cartoons, draw pictures, and play games on computers. Teens mostly use the Internet on computers or laptops to use their favorite social networking sites, find information to finish their schoolwork, and have fun.Adults frequently use computers to connect to the internet, check their email, learn new software, make presentations, shop online, and listen to their preferred music.%%Q.2:Do you believe that all of the information found online is accurate?
%%Answer:  We should be wary of information we see or find online unless it comes from a reliable source and publisher.Although the Internet is an amazing source of information, it is also full of fabricated information and fake news.As a result, I wouldn't trust anything I saw online unless it came from a reputable source.I would, for instance, believe a piece of information that I find on a website like www.bbc.com, the official government website, or a well-known and mainstream online newspaper.However, any news that comes from a questionable website or from a social networking site like Facebook should always be checked before being believed to be true.
%%Q.3:How can internet users locate trustworthy information?
%%Answer:  To obtain accurate information, individuals must rely on reputable websites with a long history of popularity, well-known mainstream online newspapers, government websites, and fact-finding sources.Before sharing anything found on social networking platforms, which are frequently the target of spammers and producers of fake news, it is always best to verify the information.
%%Google Scholar is a great place to find authentic academic papers, and the Google image search feature can be used to determine whether an image is fake or real.The well-known encyclopedia is reliable because it provides real information.Examining the credentials of the author and publisher is yet another excellent method for weeding out fake news.Finally, individuals ought to use their common sense.If a deal sounds too good to be true or a story has so many unbelievable details, people should investigate further.
%%Q.4:How has our way of life been affected by the internet?
%%Answer:  Sincerely, the way we live our lives has been transformed by the Internet.How people in the pre-internet era managed to complete all of their work at home or in the office is beyond many of us!The Intenet makes it possible for us to communicate with anyone anywhere in the world and work more efficiently both at home and in the office.With the help of the Internet, we can communicate with loved ones via video calls, shop online, attend meetings in other cities, and even drive our automobiles.We can access a wealth of information with just a few mouse clicks thanks to this technology.We even conduct our banking online these days, so it's no longer necessary to travel far for everyday tasks.Accordingly the current period with the marvelous power and gifts of the Web is genuinely striking.
%%However, this wonderful technology has a drawback.Our overreliance on the web has made us home-driven and we like to remain at home as opposed to heading outside and mingling.We frequently do not realize how this affects our social and personal lives.
%%Q.5:How has the internet affected our work practices?
%%Answer:  The way we work has also been drastically altered by the Internet.Nowadays, a lot of people work from home, and the Internet has given the younger generation thousands of jobs. This was made possible by the technology's widespread acceptance.We can save a lot of data on the Internet, which makes it simple to access them later.Blogs, video conferencing software, email, and project management software are today's office essentials.We would have made more mistakes if we hadn't had access to the Internet, and we would still have needed to keep track of every calculation with the help of paper and pens.In most modern workplaces, employees use computers to complete tasks and learn new skills.
%%Q.6:Do you believe that children should not use the internet without adult supervision?
%%Answer:  I accept, youngsters ought not be permitted to utilize the Web without a management from guardians of some kind.Although The Intent is an excellent source of information and entertainment, it also contains harmful content that could harm children's psychological well-being, and predators frequently seek out children to harm.Therefore, parents should either physically be present when their children use the Internet or impose stringent parental controls on the browser and network level that monitor children's online activities and filter out harmful content.It is for their safety, not to restrict children's freedom.

%%Topic:Art.
%%Q.1.Outline the overarching goal of art.Also, explain why people enjoy art.
%%Answer:  Humans' existence and experiences are "unique."As a result, it stands to reason that we all have distinctive requirements and expectations.However, enjoying art seems to be one of the things that distinguishes humans from animals in terms of our distinct needs and expectations.
%%Anyway, what is the universally useful of craftsmanship?The answer is that art helps us see ourselves a little bit "closer" by explaining our desire and expectation in greater detail than would otherwise be possible.We are able to communicate our social, political, cultural, and spiritual ideas in a much more organized way thanks to art. As a result, we feel "challenged" to rethink the issues and topics that affect us and our surroundings every day.
%%Art makes us appreciate our lives in a more positive light, which is why we enjoy it.By combining our "unusual motifs" that weave their way into our "subconscious" (or "hidden" us) and altering our mood, art also makes us feel free to travel into a different realm, which is another reason we enjoy it.
%%Q.2.Do you think that when it comes to teaching children, art is just as important as academic subjects?
%%Answer:  According to a quote by Pablo Picasso, "every child is an artist."The issue is how to continue being an artist when he grows up.To ensure a holistic approach to education, it is crucial to provide children with the necessary space to create, explore, and express themselves through art.However, the goal of studying art as a subject in school is not to produce "world-class artists," and it should not be taught that way. Instead, it should teach students how to explore feelings and experiences and beautifully express them, something that "words," which we use on a daily basis, are unable to do on their own.Every child has the opportunity to experience and gain from this.In other words, the children ought to be able to recognize the true value of "art" not only in the "end product," but also in the process itself.
%%Q.3.What are the benefits and drawbacks of art school?
%%Answer:  Art education has a number of advantages.In fact, numerous studies indicate that students benefit socially and academically from art education because it encourages self-directed learning, enhances creative problem-solving abilities, and sharpens critical thinking.By connecting students to both their own culture and the rest of the world, the arts challenge students of all levels.Studies also indicate that bringing art education into other subjects helps reach students who might not otherwise be interested in and "engaged" in class works.
%%However, art education also comes with some drawbacks.Learning art can take a long time, and it can sometimes take a "decade" to become successful in the "business" of art.Another major drawback of art is that most people don't really know what "art" is, so they don't learn to "appreciate" it, whether it's music, painting, or drama. This can be really depressing and demotivating for people who want to be artists.
%%Q.4.Why do you think some people like to look at sculptures and paintings while others don't?
%%Answer:  I believe that the degree of one's "art education" is primarily responsible for the difference between those who enjoy looking at paintings and sculptures and those who do not.In addition, this is a matter of "sensibility" and the extent to which certain artworks evoke strong emotions in us.In fact, there is a theory that says that because colors, shapes, sounds, and thoughts are all waves, and because a piece of art is essentially an expression of or transmission of an emotion, the more sensitive we are to these waves, the better we can understand an emotional message.Also, another "theory" says that most people who are "visually intelligent" love art, but that people who can't focus on a single detail for more than ten seconds can't enjoy it.
%%Q.5.What are some of the benefits and drawbacks of being an artist?
%%Answer:  On a metaphysical level, being an artist has the advantage of having a greater sensitivity to the environment and being able to nurture it with a childlike playfulness toward experiences throughout one's life by creating something "beautiful and special."However, being an artist gives you the freedom to become your own "boss" without having to worry about "satisfying" others.
%%However, one of the main drawbacks of being an artist is that most of the time, they are unable to make ends meet financially, and they must rely on other sources of income to survive.An artist also has little or no social life as a result.Being an artist has a number of drawbacks, one of which is that the majority of people do not view "art" as a legitimate "profession," which can be equally demoralizing and frustrating for someone who values their "self-respect."
%%Q.6.Do you believe that some people are better artists by nature than others?
%%Answer:  Yes, I do believe that genetic structure and predisposition to "creativity" are the primary reasons why some people are naturally better artists than others, just as some people are better academically at science and mathematics.In point of fact, I am of the opinion that it is the "genetic disposition" of some children to spend a lot of time as children participating in creative activities, such as drawing, singing, or whatever they enjoyed, in order to develop their skills in the process of play in the early years of their lives.
%%Naturally, there are those who would prefer to argue that their "passion" is what motivates them to become "better" artists.But even if I agree with them to some extent just for the "sake of debate," I still think that they wouldn't be able to become "better" artists if it weren't for their "natural inclination or disposition."
%%Topic:eating routines
%%Q.1.Please describe the kinds of food that people in your nation consume.
%%Answer:  I suppose it's fair to say that we all enjoy eating, but what we eat is largely determined by where we live and the types of foods available there.Steam rice and curries, for instance, are the staples of my neighborhood's diet. Curries are made by combining fish, meat, and vegetables with a variety of spices in the right proportions.Additionally, we frequently consume "bread" in conjunction with our favorite curries and sweets.
%%Naturally, the foods I just mentioned are everyday foods for everyday occasions.We make dishes like "chicken biriyani" and "mutton biriyani" for special occasions by combining meats of our choice with a particular kind of long-grain rice with a great aromatic flavor, like basmati, and adding a mixture of freshly ground spices to make the dish even more delicious.Then there are the fast food options, which we also like to eat sparingly.
%%Q.2.In what ways are current eating habits in your country distinct from those of the past?
%%Answer:  People in my country used to primarily eat steam rice, curry, bread, and local fruits and vegetables, all of which were prepared at home.However, over the course of the past few decades, we have observed that some "not-so" traditional foods like pasta, pizza, French fries, burgers, and sandwiches, which are typically prepared and served at fast food establishments and restaurants, have also entered our regular food menus. Of course, this is relevant to the food habits of my nation.Consequently, we are becoming increasingly "reliant" on fast food rather than home-cooked meals, which have ruled our appetites for hundreds of years, especially in big cities.Even ordering for "home delivery"—something that wasn't even remotely possible a decade ago—is something we are doing!
%%Q.3.How healthy is the food in your country?
%%Answer:  Some people in the world choose to eat food primarily for its "awesome taste," with nutritional value taking a secondary role, while others choose to eat food primarily for its "purely" nutritional value.We fall into the "food lovers" category, for better or worse. We eat foods primarily for their "awesome taste," but the foods we choose to eat in our country are healthy as well.
%%In fact, I would say that the only reason our food isn't always as "healthy" as we'd like it to be is that people in my country like to eat a little bit too many spices in their food for "additional taste and flavor."Aside from that, I'm pretty sure that my country's food is pretty healthy because we boil and cook it right.
%%Q.4.How has technology altered our work practices?
%%Answer:  The way we work has changed as a result of technology, which has made workplace conditions so much better that it will be practically impossible to work without technology these days.When we talk about communication in our workplaces, we will see that technology has made it faster, more instantaneous, more collaborative, and more cohesive. This applies to communication between managers and employees as well as between managers and subordinates.
%%Our workplaces and businesses are much more organized than they were before thanks to the use of computer software like project management software. This software makes it easier to build, delegate, review, and evaluate a task much more quickly, thereby assisting in keeping everything on track.Due to the use of technology, both large and small businesses can now use science and math more than ever before to ascertain what their customers want, as opposed to relying primarily on "hunches" in the past.There are numerous other instances similar to these.
%%Q.5.What distinguishes blue-collar work from white-collar work?
%%Answer:  There are hundreds of people in an organization who are identified by the color of their uniform, and the colors of the uniform indicate the "type" of jobs performed by the employees in that organization.In an organization, blue-collar jobs are those performed by manual laborers who are compensated on an hourly or daily basis depending on how well they perform their duties.Higher education is not required for blue-collar jobs.However, a worker needs to be proficient enough in a specialized field to complete the tasks effectively.Manufacturing, mining, construction, repairs and maintenance, machine installation, and other related jobs might be included.
%%White-collar jobs, on the other hand, require employees to perform clerical duties in an office without getting their clothes "dirty" and receive a fixed monthly salary.The majority of white-collar workers hold advanced degrees or certifications.
%%Due to the high demand for skilled laborers and the low pay scale of white-collar jobs, the distinction between blue-collar and white-collar jobs is diminishing over time.
%%Q.6.Which jobs do you think contribute the most to society?
%%Answer:  This, in my opinion, is a very "subjective" question because the answer almost entirely depends on a person's needs and preferences.A society that places a high value on engineers and doctors won't exactly be able to comprehend and appreciate the value of a "trash collector."In a similar vein, a career as a "teacher" won't exactly do well in a society where agricultural labor is highly prized.However, if I had to choose two occupations that contribute the most to society, I would choose "farming" and "medical doctor" because both of them save lives.A medical doctor saves our lives by diagnosing the disease and prescribing medicines for us when our lives are in danger, while farmers save our lives by producing food for us to eat.

%%Topic:Work.
%%Q.1.When choosing a job, do you think job satisfaction is more important than salary?
%%Answer:  Finding a job you enjoy and working your way up to a high salary are the fundamental tenets of seeking work-related fulfillment.But unfortunately, life isn't really that easy, especially when there aren't many options and everyone has different choices.
%%From where they see their life, I would say that salary is more important to many people than job "satisfaction" because the more money they have, the better they will be able to meet their "needs."However, more important to me than the money I will make from my job is job satisfaction.
%%Q.2.What skills do you believe are necessary to land a good job in this day and age?
%%Answer:  In the past, having a good degree or certification and good results made it possible for us to land good jobs.However, in today's world, obtaining a good job requires more than just a good degree and good performance.We also need to have some "soft skills," such as great people and communication skills, the ability to plan and organize, work well in teams, solve problems, and manage our time effectively.In addition, we need to be "connected" to a community of professionals working in the same fields as us.Lastly, in today's job market, having knowledge and skills in technology, particularly with computers and the internet, are also important.
%%Q.3.Do you believe that women should be able to perform the same tasks as men?
%%Answer 1:Dealing with this issue is difficult.However, I will express my opinion with complete candor.Women shouldn't necessarily be able to do the same jobs as men because of their different job expectations, physical build, and concerns about job safety.
%%Women shouldn't be operating drilling machines to make holes in the streets or working in the military engineering core to build a bridge in a day.Additionally, women should not be employed in occupations that require them to perform "heavy lifting" or ascend an electric power plant.In point of fact, I would venture to assert that women were not made to perform tasks that men are capable of, but rather to perform tasks that men are unable to.
%%Q.4.How has technology altered our work practices?
%%Answer:  The way we work has changed as a result of technology, which has made workplace conditions so much better that it will be practically impossible to work without technology these days.When we talk about communication in our workplaces, we will see that technology has made it faster, more instantaneous, more collaborative, and more cohesive.

%%Topic:Transport.
%%Q.1.In your nation, how do the majority of people travel long distances?
%%Answer:  In Bangladesh, where I live, the majority of people travel long distances by bus or train.There are approximately 3000 kilometers of railway and more than 21,000 kilometers of road in Bangladesh.Nearly 75 million people took the train in 2017 alone.However, a very small number of wealthy individuals have begun to use domestic flights as well.In the past, water transports were widely used throughout the nation, but in recent years, only villages have used them.
%%Q.2.Over the past few decades, how much has the way people get around changed?
%%Answer:  As a developing nation, Bangladesh is still heavily dependent on affordable public transportation. However, over the course of the past few decades, the country has gradually begun to prefer private transportation over public transportation due to their "easy" availability, which includes private cars, private minivans, and private commercial buses.Naturally, the country's steady economic growth over the past few decades is to blame for this shift.One more tremendous change, which my nation has seen over the most recent couple of many years, is that the quantity of motorbikes has soar (due to their accessibility and reasonableness) as an ever increasing number of individuals are depending on these two-wheeled vehicles to travel brief distance rather effectively and helpfully.
%%Q.3.What kind of progress has your nation's transportation system made in recent years?
%%Answer:  As more wide highways and roads have been constructed to facilitate the transportation of more vehicles from one region of the country to another, Bangladesh's road and transportation system has significantly improved in recent years.In addition, elevated expressways and significant bridges over major rivers have been constructed to significantly shorten travel times and lengths between regions of the country.
%%Concerning the enhancements in vehicles, an ever increasing number of sumptuous transports and trains with cooling frameworks have been added, both in private and public areas, to as of late guarantee the solace and extravagance for the travelers.As more and more passengers become interested in using air routes, the number of domestic plane flights has also significantly increased in recent years.
%%Q.4.Do you believe that improvements in transportation will likely continue in the future?
%%Answer:  Yes, the county is well on its way to becoming a middle-income developed nation in the next decade or so, so I have every reason to believe that the improvement in our transportation sector will continue to improve.In addition, Bangladesh cannot afford to delay the development of its road infrastructure and overall transportation system due to the country's ever-increasing economic and development activities.In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if, in the not-too-distant future, a significant number of people choose to save time and travel from one region of the country to another by air.
%%Q.5.Do you think that public transportation should be used by most people?If not, why not?
%%Answer:  Yes, I believe that public transportation should be utilized by the majority of people, depending on their availability, as they appear to be more affordable and dependable in the majority of cases.In addition, in a developing nation like Bangladesh, allowing private citizens to dominate a specific service sector almost certainly will open the door to "abuse" and "exploitation" of the existing system to "reap off" citizens financially.In addition, as a result of an increasing number of people using public transportation, the nation will be able to "cap" the "indiscriminate use" of private transportation, even when it is not required, to keep roads and streets from becoming overcrowded.Additionally, we will be able to maintain a "cap" on air pollution in our nation as a result.
%%Q.6. What is the situation in your country and why do some nations impose higher taxes on auto ownership?
%%Answer:  The reduction of air pollution and discouragement of citizens from purchasing and using an increasing number of private automobiles are the primary goals of imposing high taxes on automobile ownership.
%%My nation is not significantly different when it comes to imposing higher taxes on automobile ownership.In point of fact, the number of private automobiles has increased to such an extent over the past ten years that the government has been forced to impose a tax on the ownership of new automobiles that can, in some cases, amount to 300 percent of the purchase price!
%%Countries with a large number of travelers and severely limited road infrastructure naturally have high taxes because the government tries to limit the number of private cars on the streets.This ought to also be common in nations where air pollution levels are higher than usual.


%%Topic:Famous Individual
%%Q.1.Do you believe that famous people generally have a happier life than the average person?
%%Answer:  The problem with the definition of "happiness" is that there is no universally agreed-upon definition or meaning.In point of fact, everyone makes the decision to define happiness in the manner in which they see fit.
%%So, do famous people typically experience greater happiness than average people?Since "happiness" is merely a mental state, I would venture to say that being "famous" has nothing to do with being "happier."Naturally, celebrities tend to be happier than the average person due to the ease with which they can satisfy their "needs and wants."Sadly, however, we frequently conflate happiness with satisfaction.Nonetheless, does that fundamentally imply that celebrities can't be more joyful than common individuals?The response is, of course, that they can be, but not because they are "famous," but rather because, like "ordinary" people, they "choose" to remain content with or without having the "satisfaction" in life.
%%Q.2.What qualities are necessary for someone to become famous?
%%Answer:  It's not easy to become famous and "successful."However, if a person possesses certain characteristics throughout their life, they can become famous on their own by triumphing over all obstacles."Passion, persistence (or patience), hard work, a positive attitude, self-reliance, self-confidence, integrity, and rock-strong willpower" are among these qualities.Naturally, fame can only be achieved by a person who has had their fair share of "luck."However, I would say that out of all these qualities, "patience" may end up being the most important and decisive factor in achieving "fame," as one may have to wait a long time for it.However, it is important to note that a person's "success" will likely be very "short-lived" if their sole goal is to become "famous" by any means necessary and without necessarily comprehending the "value" of doing so.
%%Q.3.Is it easier or harder to become famous today than it was during your grandparents' time?
%%Answer:  Yes, for better or worse, it is easier today to "achieve" fame than it was in our grandparents' time. This is primarily due to the fact that people now have more opportunities to advertise themselves on a variety of media channels thanks to technological advancements.In addition, it appears that our fame has necessitated a significant "compromise" with conventional social and cultural norms.In point of fact, it appears that the more one is able to act "out of the box," the easier it is for them to become famous.A friend of mine is somewhat well-known in his community and has more than 80.000 YouTube followers.Due to modern technological advancements, it was unheard of during the time of my grandparents.
%%Q.4.Give examples of how famous people have an impact on the public.
%%Answer:  People can be influenced and inspired by the talent, hard work, sincerity, and styles of famous people, whether they are in sports, politics, the film industry, business, or any other field.Famous people's personal lives, approaches to issues, and relationships can sometimes serve as models for the general public.But the problem is that sometimes people forget about their own responsibilities because they may not be able to accept their favorite famous people's mistakes.Sometimes, they even try to justify not only their own mistakes but also those of their favorite famous people, which can actually lead the general public astray.
%%Q.5.Do you believe that famous people are held to higher standards than ordinary people?
%%Answer:  Yes, I do think that famous people are expected to do more than average people because being famous usually means they have more "power" and "influence" to do good things economically, socially, and culturally to help people with little or no "power."Celebrities likewise have the ability to impart or to arrive at a huge portion of normal residents as they are the pioneers to their devotees generally.As a result, it is only natural for the average person to expect famous people to have a strong sense of responsibility in order to help others live better lives.
%%Q.6.In your nation, what kinds of people become famous?Do you wish to be well-known?
%%Answer:  In my nation, sportspeople and people who work in the film industry typically achieve fame quickly.Additionally, politicians are not particularly far behind them.The difference, however, is that, in my opinion, famous people in the film and sports industries are "famous" because the majority of average citizens genuinely like them due to their creativity and performance, whereas famous politicians are "famous" because people "like" them out of "fear."
%%Yes, I would like to be famous one day, but I definitely don't want to become famous "overnight" like many "so-called" famous people these days who have basically changed the "rules of the game" for the worse.
%%Topic:Holiday.
%%Q.1.Why do you suppose people take vacations?
%%Answer:  Life is too short to spend our entire lives doing the same things over and over until we become "bored" to death.Going on vacation seems to be the best way to get rid of this "boredom," as doing something different from time to time is the only way to get rid of it.As a result, people take vacations to unwind and have fun, which also helps them feel less stressed and boosts their immunity.In point of fact, some studies indicate that people who do not take vacations are 21 percent more likely to die from all causes.You become more optimistic about your life and the world around you when you go on vacation because you are exposed to new environments, different human behaviors, cultures, and different ways of doing things.To put it another way, going on vacation serves as an unstructured education in which you learn about "treasures of lessons" that you can't learn otherwise.
%%Q.2.How essential is it for families to travel together on vacation?
%%Answer:  Because we have a propensity to compromise on our relationships, especially within our families, when we are working or doing something, it is crucial for families to take holidays together.In fact, we frequently miss out on family gatherings and regular opportunities to bond because of "work deadlines" that take precedence in our lives.We will have to wait a very, very long time if we wait for our retirements to make up for the time and opportunities we lost.
%%However, fortunately, whenever we get the chance, we can make up for the time and opportunities we lost by going on vacations with our families and carefully planning them.To put it another way, we should never underestimate the power of holidays as a very good way to strengthen our families' bonds, even if it means having a family meal together for an hour.
%%Q.3.Why do some people take vacations by themselves?
%%Answer:  Traveling alone can be an extremely liberating experience for some people, allowing them to do exactly what they want to do, when they want to do it, and how they want to do it.If you go on vacation by yourself, there won't be any arguments, compromises, or concerns about where to go or what to eat.Some people also prefer to travel on their own because they don't like having to deal with other people's "annoying" ways.
%%Q.4.What types of holidays will become increasingly popular in the future?
%%Answer:  We can debate the types of holidays that will be most popular in the future all we want, but one thing is certain: some of them will be really "hi-tech" and much more "luxurious" than they are now.It's interesting to note that a 2014 article on the types of vacations that would be most popular in the future—in 2024, to be exact—predicted that guests would "have no need to encounter a single human being" from the moment they check into the hotel to the moment they check out.That is to say, robots will complete the task.In fact, hotel rooms will become digital, hyper-interactive environments in which even the pillows will be "embedded" with electronic devices to massage your neck and rouse you in the morning!Presently, in the event that that wasn't enough was business as usual for you, kindly stand by till you read what else the paper needed to say!In any case, it continued with the statement that "the walls will display high-definition images of your friends and family, hologram personal trainers will hang out with you, and the shower will use sound technology to "agitate" dirt from your body, using a traffic light system to indicate when you’re clean enough to get out."That sounds cool!Isn't it?
%%Q.5.Is it better to go on vacation in your own country or somewhere else?Why?
%%Answer:  I would say that spending a vacation in my own country would be preferable to traveling abroad due to the country's abundance of unique architecture, mountains, snow, green spaces, and blue oceans.In fact, more than 30 million tourists visit my nation annually, making it one of the top ten most popular destinations worldwide.As a result, I'd rather be interested in seeing my own beautiful nation than distant nations.In addition, spending my vacations in my own nation would undoubtedly make me feel more at ease and secure.In addition, due to the country's relatively large size, I have not visited the majority of its regions.So, if I go to some of those places, I might get to see something truly special here in my own country without ever having to go to another country to see it.Obviously, I have nothing against traveling to other countries; however, given what I already have in my own country, I would always choose it over other countries as a popular vacation spot.
%%Q.6.What issues might travelers encounter while on vacation?
%%Answer:  When going on vacation in a new country, people can run into a number of issues, especially if they don't speak the language of the people there.For instance, you might lose your significant stuff, or you, when all is said and done, could become mixed up during the time spent venturing out starting with one spot then onto the next, and you would be in genuine difficulty in the event that you were unable to convey your concerns appropriately to local people.You would likewise experience difficulty becoming accustomed to the food of an unfamiliar land regardless of how "colorful" and flavorful they might sound.However, getting seriously ill while on vacation would be the most significant issue.Given that you are traveling alone, you do not have any family or close friends, and you do not have adequate health insurance, so if you ever get sick, your life could be in serious danger in a foreign country.
%%Topic:Technology.
%%Q.1.Describe the benefits and drawbacks of contemporary technology.
%%Answer:  Because modern technology is now an essential part of our lives, we will have to live with it, regardless of how we feel about it.
%%I can say that one of the benefits of modern technology is that it has made our lives much simpler than they were a few decades ago.By increasing output, quality, and efficiency at all levels, it has revolutionized our production systems across all businesses and industries.With the advent of the internet, communication between us has become so simple and quick that even though we are thousands of miles apart, we can still communicate via video.In addition, smart devices like the iPad, iPhone, Galaxy tablets, and others have made it relatively simple for us to access virtually any type of information at any time and from any location.Lastly, modern technology has made it very easy for us to travel very quickly over long distances.In fact, electric trains, airplanes, and fast cars allow us to travel a distance of 10 miles in just a few minutes, if not less. This was almost impossible just a few decades ago.
%%However, one of the biggest drawbacks of modern technology is that it renders us "idle" to the point where we don't even bother to use a calculator to perform even the most basic addition or subtraction calculations.However, the issue with such "inaction" is that we are actually destroying some of our brain's memory cells.Modern technology is also being used to kill and destroy people on Earth because it helps make new war weapons that are so advanced that even a few decades ago, it was hard to imagine them.Lastly, given that the majority of technological advancements aim to reduce human effort, it would only result in an increase in the amount of work performed by machines rather than humans.In addition, as processes become automated and humans simply cannot compete with them, more and more people are losing their jobs to machines.
%%Q.2.How has technology altered your culture?
%%Answer:  Technology has altered our society, for better or worse, in terms of how we live and interact with one another.Furthermore, it has altered our "mobility."We no longer rely on a single source of income in this day and age because of technology, and as a result, society has become more "affluent" than it was in the past.We now have the ability to travel to any location at any time without wasting time, which is another remarkable change that has changed our society for the better.In addition, my small society has the impression that it has suddenly become a part of a "much bigger global community" due to the development of information technology like smartphones and the internet.
%%Q.3.How has communication been altered by technology?
%%Answer:  With the advent of the internet, mobile phones, and other smart devices, it may be safe to say that technology has significantly altered the manner in which we communicate with one another. Although it has changed virtually every aspect of our lives,
%%The adage "talk is cheap" has been proven right by technology, so cheap that we talk to each other almost constantly through our phones, whether we're close to each other or far apart, even when we don't need to.Since we can do the same thing in seconds by pressing a button on our phones, we have also become lazy to walk even 100 feet or for a few minutes when we need to communicate with our friends or family.We simply leave or send a message on social media networks and "messengers" to inform others of our "status" when we are not in the mood or really lazy to "talk."Finally, thanks to the internet, we can see each other on live video while communicating, regardless of where we live. This has made communication truly "personal."
%%Q.4.How have long-distance relationships changed as a result of technology?
%%Answer:  The nature of long-distance relationships has mostly improved as a result of technology.To communicate with one another in the past, we had to use expensive "long-distance" calls from our land phones or "postal mails."However, due to the limited "infrastructure" required to ensure these services in an effective manner, even that was occasionally impossible.However, thanks to advancements in communication infrastructure and technologies, such as smartphones and the internet, we are now able to not only communicate with one another in a matter of seconds but also see each other live on video, even if we reside in different parts of the world.Also, it shouldn't really come as a surprise if one day we see the "postal mails" preserved in a museum as a "thing of the past."
%%Q.5.When it comes to interpersonal relationships, what are the limitations that technology places on them?
%%Answer:  For our overall well-being, maintaining a healthy "interpersonal relationship" is very important.Unfortunately, modern technology has taken the all-important "emotion" away from us, which has had a significant negative impact on our lives.In point of fact, as a result of the development of technology, we have become so occupied and "robotic" that we don't even bother to say hello to the people who are closest to us, much less spend some quality "family time" with them.As a result, our "personal ties and bonds" with our friends and family are becoming increasingly shaky, which is certainly not good news for our society's well-being, especially when it comes to the elderly.
%%Q.6.How could technology be seen as a barrier to our progress?Can we get past it?
%%Answer:  When we place an excessive amount of reliance on modern technology, it can be viewed as an obstacle for us.In point of fact, it would not be an exaggeration to assert that technology is preventing our physical and mental development and physical potential.For instance, prior to the development of modern technology, we would walk to a nearby grocery store to purchase our groceries. This was unquestionably beneficial to our minds and health because it allowed us to feel more isolated from our natural surroundings.However, because we are simply too lazy to step outside of our comfort zone, we now simply perform the same task by riding in our vehicles.What comes out of this "laziness"?With a big "O," obesity is the answer!
%%Notwithstanding, the best, and furthermore the most risky simultaneously, as I would like to think, obstruction is that we have really begun to accept that without innovation, we actually will not have the option to get by.To put it another way, we are entrusting ourselves to the "mercy" of technology, and if, for the love of God, it ever ceases to function, our very existence as a species will be in jeopardy.So, can we get past this obstacle?Yes, we can if we just make ourselves physically and mentally more "active" and reduce our reliance on technology.
%%Topic:Making of choices.
%%Q.1.Why do some people struggle with decision-making?
%%Answer:  Why do some people have a hard time making decisions?They most likely belong to the "libra" zodiac sign!Putting that little aside, I really wished the response to this question were straightforward, but sadly, it isn't.However, I would like to attribute this "indecision" primarily to the "fear" of the outcomes that would follow the decision's implementation because humans, in general, are afraid of the "unknown" even when the "odds" are strongly in favor of positive outcomes.For some people, it's hard to make decisions because they don't have enough data and information to make an "informed" decision.
%%Q.2.When making decisions, how important is it to seek advice from others?
%%Answer:  I think it's very important to always get advice from other people when making decisions, mainly because it will help you learn about a variety of ideas and possibilities for the kinds of outcomes you should expect.In addition, if we are open to receiving advice from others, there is a good chance that we will be able to learn about the outcomes of similar decisions made in the past.Last but not least, we ought to be willing to listen to other people's opinions when making decisions, even if they don't help us right now. There is always a chance that they will help us in the future.
%%Q.3.Why is it sometimes hard to listen to advice?
%%Answer:  Some people find it difficult to accept advice at times, primarily due to an inherent human trait known as the "ego."We sometimes refuse to listen to advice or see the "truth" because of this "ego."To put it another way, we believe that we know things "better" than others, and we fear that if we take advice from others, it will "degrade" us in front of them.Naturally, it also has something to do with the "reliability and trustworthiness" of the advice providers.
%%The "location" in which a piece of advice is offered also has a significant impact on whether or not it will be taken up.For instance, if we want to tell someone not to do something when he is extremely busy working at his office, chances are good that he won't listen.
%%Q.4.What are some of the most significant choices that young people face?
%%Answer:  Just because they are referred to as "young," young people are not "exempted" from making crucial decisions.In point of fact, they are also required to make some significant life choices, such as selecting a career path;when to get married and start a family, or what subjects to study at universities.Last but not least, if young people want to live a happy and healthy life for the rest of their lives, they need to make decisions about what kind of "financial" and "health" habits they will adopt.
%%Q.5.Do you agree that important decisions affecting children should be made by parents?
%%Answer:  Until their children reach "adulthood," parents should make important decisions for their children with their consent and with the input and opinion of the children.However, parents should allow their children to make important decisions on their own when they are older and ready to leave the "nest."Children will probably never learn how to take "risks" in life and live on their own if parents don't let them make important decisions.In fact, even if their children are hesitant, parents should always encourage them to make decisions.After all, parents won't always be there to support their children when they need it most.
%%Q.6.Is it better to consider what you want when making a decision or what other people want?
%%Answer:  Yes, it is always better to think about what I really want before making a decision than to worry about what other people really want. This is because I will have to live with any decision I make for the rest of my life in one way or another.Naturally, it is never a bad idea to consult with the people we love or care about and inquire about their wishes from time to time in order to get them on board with my decision; however, the decision will always be mine based on what I really want.
%%One thing to note is that one does not worry about what other people want. This is not because one has no regard for other people at all; rather, it is because the person making the decision would be able to achieve their goal much more easily because they are so closely involved in the decision.
