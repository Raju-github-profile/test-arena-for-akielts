        %% • Usually these types of questions ask you to write down facts and figures such as times and dates.
%% • Because you need to know what kind of information you are hearing, you need to be ready when you hear it.
%% • You'll often hear a lot of information that can fill a gap, so don't rush it, wait for confirmation.
%% • Sometimes speakers correct their own answers, which means that the first answer they gave was incorrect. Example:
'The bus departs at 6:30 pm. Oh, wait a minute, no, it didn't work, it left at 6:40. ' So watch out for this trick.
%% • Sometimes, between recordings, it's okay to take a short break. Avoid using this time to check previous answers and instead use it to pre-read and understand the upcoming question.
%% • Don't "delay" a question if you're not sure, try to guess and get ready for the next question.
%% • If you hear words like 'even if', 'but' or 'however', it could be a sign that the meaning of a sentence will be changed in a way that could affect choice your.

                %% A labeling map or chart is provided. You have to keep typing your answer while listening to the audio.
        %% Important Information*:
        %%All information is the same as above except
        . %% • Pay attention to the instructions:
        %% • Draw a mini compass in the corner of the questionnaire before the sound sounds.
        %% • Familiarize yourself with the items and question numbers on the cards or diagrams given.
        %% • Pay attention to the demonstrative words while listening to the audio.
        %% • If possible, place the fingers of your non-writing hand on the map to keep track of the direction of the sound.
        %% • Let's look at some of these words before practicing these types of questions.
        %%NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST*
        %%At/ On Up/ At/ Up Up/ West East South East South of West East South North of West
        %%Up Down Right Left Slight North of
        %%Slight South East Slight West
        %%There are some other options, such as:
        %% • Opposite-%%This means on the opposite side of something. This is usually spoken immediately after the signal to the far end. This means you have to change sides quickly to keep up with the speaker's pace.
        %% • Southwest / Northwest / Southeast / Northeast-%%This is simply he two directions combined, as you might see on the example map.
        %% • Middle-%%This is simply the center (or center) of the chart or map. This can also be central to what is explicitly stated in the example (e.g.
        in the middle of the library).
        %% • Inside/Outside-%%This is usually used in maps to indicate an area where something is located. It can be either outside or inside something.
        %% • Opposite/In Front-%%Like the Opposite option, this could be on the opposite side or in front of something.
        %% • Clockwise/Counterclockwise-%%This is useful for understanding and common in exams. Imagine a clock running (to the right). That is, clockwise. The opposite direction (left) is counterclockwise. This is usually included at the beginning of the prompt you hear and must be followed correctly by the test taker in order to correctly answer the rest of the question. So remember the difference between these two words.
        %% • A Little Ahead  This is a general term for cards. It usually appears immediately after one landmark, then immediately before another landmark. For example: "The grocery store is just behind the library." In this case, it means the library is a little further away than the grocery store.
        %% • Past Right-%%This is another common term for cards. Similar to the phrase '' a little further'', this comes just after one landmark and just before another, for example ''The police station is right behind his shopping mall.'' In this case , means something in the immediate vicinity.
        %% • Before-%%This is spoken when something happened before something else. For example: "The Children's Center is in front of the History Museum". To understand the direction, you must pay attention to the previous directions and follow the speaker's path. For this reason, it is usually not one of the first instructions spoken.
        %% • After-%%This is spoken when something follows another. For example: "The Children's Center is after the History Museum". To understand the direction, you must pay attention to the previous directions and follow the speaker's path. For this reason, it is usually not one of the first instructions spoken.
        %% • Adjacent -This is a common term used in diagrams and plans to mean that something is connected to something else.
        %% • Enter through/via-%%This is usually included in maps to indicate how to reach another area of  the map. Example: "When you enter the kitchen, go through the lobby."
        %% • Go Through-%%This expression is common in maps and plans to mean that something goes through something. Example: "The river flow through the park" means that the river flows through and is within the park.
        %% • Runs Alongside-%%This expression, common in maps and plans, means that something is next to something rather than inside it. For example, "The river runs along the park." means outside, not inside, along the length of the park.

        %%The instructions vary and the limit can be TWO WORD AND/OR NUMBER or ONE WORD, so don't be surprised.
        %% • Order of answers*
        %%The answers will be in the same order in the recording as they are listed in the question, so for this question you will hear answer 1 first, then answer 1. answer 2 and so on. This makes it easier to choose answers than if they were randomly ordered.
        %% • Predicting the answer*
        %%Try to predict what the answer might be. This will help you focus your mind on what you need to hear in the recording. Sometimes you'll be able to predict from the facts, but most of the time it's one or more of these that you'll be able to identify:
        
        %%Type of information needed, eg. name, date, time, phone number, address, price.
        %%Mandatory word types, eg. noun, adjective, verb.
        %% • Synonyms and interpretations*
        %%Synonyms and interpretations will be used extensively in the recording. So you will not only hear the exact words used in the questions, but also different words and expressions that have the same meaning.
        %%During your preparation, go through the questions and underline key words that could be replaced with synonyms or paraphrases. Then, quickly think of words that could be used instead.
        %% • Problem vocabulary*
        %%There are 6 types of vocabulary that can cause specific problems for students and some are commonly used in short answer questions. 6 types are; Time, Number, Price, Date, Mail, Address. You must be able to recognize them orally and write them correctly in your answer.
        %% • Beware of distractions*
        %%The examiner may try to catch you with distracting things. A distraction is a word or phrase that alters or corrects information originally given. So you can get a response and then get it back. The use of "but" and "however" are particularly common distractions, but there are many different words and phrases that can be used to change or correct information, so save Notice those words.

        %%General Education and Academic Education candidates take the same IELTS listening test. Both exams consist of 40 questions, 10 each for him. This means that the test is divided into her four parts. The audio is 30 minutes total, plus she has 10 minutes to write down the test answers on the answer sheet.
%%As already mentioned, each test he consists of four sections, each more difficult than the previous one. So part 2 is harder than part 1, part 3 is harder than part 2, and part 3 is harder than part 4. Each part has a different topic and purpose. The audio can only be heard once by him and no one plays or pauses the audio, but there is a 30 second grace period between each question set.
%%Beginning in 2019, students will be given the opportunity to hear examples before proceeding to questions, but starting in 2020, students will no longer be able to hear examples. .
%%Section 1*
%%In this section you will listen to a dialogue between two people taking turns. This makes it easier to understand and speaks relatively slower than the speakers in later sections.
%%Most of the time this section has reservations or reservations. This section requires you to fill out a note or form. There are mostly sub-questions and you have to listen carefully to the audio. Most students find these to be the easiest parts. The context in which this sound is heard is always social. Only two people talk to each other. Easier to follow. You will have time to review your responses and review follow-up questions.
%%Section 2*
%%In this section you hear someone discussing non-academic topics. The context of this conversation is also social. Now, in this section, the conversation or speech is for two people only. They take turns speaking, but sometimes the sound from the two speakers overlaps for several seconds, confusing the listeners (students). You will have time to review your responses and review follow-up questions.
%%Part 3*
%%Mostly he has 3 speakers in this section, but sometimes it has 4. This is the part where most students have trouble following the audio stream because the speakers interrupt each other as they speak. This sonic context is often related to education and training. You will have time to review your responses and review follow-up questions.
%%Section 4* 
%%This is the final part of the listening test. Considered the most difficult of all the sections, in my opinion this part is easier than Part 3 and Part 2. This is because there is only one speaker in this section, making it easier to understand what the speaker is saying. People speak regularly. They keep talking incessantly, but they don't have time to consider the question at hand. They still use fairly technical terms and don't have to think too much about synonyms and interpretations.
