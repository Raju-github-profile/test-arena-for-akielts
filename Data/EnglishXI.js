        description: `
        SUM METHOD:
The narrative begins with the children playing every afternoon after returning from school in the Giant's garden.The garden was lovely, big, and had fruit trees and soft grass.Birds sat on the luscious fruit trees and sang sweetly.
After seven years, the giant returned one day.The Cornish Ogre, his friend, was staying with him.When they saw him, the kids were afraid.He declared that he would not permit anyone to play here because it was his own garden after observing the children playing.He added a notice board and erected a wall around it."Trespassers will be prosecuted" was the warning that was displayed on the notice board.
As they had no other place to play, the children became depressed.As they walked around the garden's high walls, they would think of the lovely garden that was inside them.
The season of spring arrived, and everywhere there were blossoms and tiny birds.However, the giant's garden was covered in frost and snow because it was winter.Birds also did not sing when there were no children around.A flower once bloomed, but when it saw the sign, it went back to sleep.The hailstorm and the North Wind followed.The giant's selfishness prevented the golden autumn fruits from reaching his garden as well.
The giant then awoke to the sound of sweet music.Outside his window, a linnet was singing.He could feel the spring as the hail and the North Wind stopped.He noticed that the children had entered his garden through a small opening.The blossoming trees were visible as the children sat on tree branches.He likewise saw the birds flying and hear
them trilling.The blossoms had also emerged.
However, to his surprise, winter was still present elsewhere.He noticed that a young boy was standing there, unable to reach the trees' branches.He was still unable to climb despite the tree lowering its branches.
His heart broke when he saw this scene.He realized he was truly very self-centered.He made the decision to remove the walls, put that boy on top of the tree, and let children play here forever.However, when the children saw him, they fled, and the garden went back into winter.However, despite his weeping, that youngster did not flee.He was placed on top of the tree by the giant, and the tree immediately blossomed.He gave the giant a kiss.
Realizing that the giant is not evil, the other children returned.They returned with the spring.Every afternoon, the giant used to play with the kids, but that little boy wasn't there.He became extremely weak over time.He saw a lovely tree in a corner with white blossoms one winter morning.The young boy stood beneath the tree, which had golden branches.
The giant was furious because the boy had been injured.He promised the boy that he would kill the person who had hurt him.He was informed by the boy that these were love's wounds.The boy asked the giant to visit his garden with a smile.Later, the children discovered the enormous corpse beneath the white blossom-covered tree.

        title: 'The Oval Portrait',
        description: `
        Summary At the beginning of "The Oval Portrait," the unnamed narrator and his servant Pedro "forcefully enter" an abandoned chateau in the Apennines.The narrator is severely injured, slightly delirious, and unable to spend the night outdoors for reasons that are never explained.The two men hide in a faraway bed room with "rich, yet tattered and antique" decorations.Due to the "bizarre architecture" of the chateau, this room has an odd shape and many nooks.The chamber
brags a number embroidered works of art, "armorial prizes," and "a bizarrely incredible number of
exceptionally lively current compositions in edges of rich brilliant arabesque."The narrator is interested in the paintings.He tells Pedro to light a tall candelabrum at the foot of the bed because he wants to think about them.A small book with an overview of the room's pictures is also found on his pillow.
The narrator is completely absorbed as she looks at the paintings and reads this guidebook while Pedro is sleeping, until finally the clock strikes midnight.He moves the candelabrum to bring more light to the book because he is unhappy with its position. As he does so, he notices a painting that he had not previously noticed.It depicts a young woman who is "just ripening into womanhood."The narrator is forced to temporarily close his eyes and wonder exactly what it is about the image that he finds so startling that it has such an overwhelming yet ambiguous effect on him.
The portrait is briefly described by the narrator."Much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully," it is a "vignette" painted.The girl's head and shoulders are shown, but the rest of her body is hidden.The execution of the painting and the beauty of its subject are both admired by the narrator, but the painting's absolute lifelikeness, which "confounds," "subdues," and "appalls" him, truly astonishes the narrator.Before returning the candelabrum to its previous position and turning to the relevant guidebook description, he spends an hour immersed in the portrait.
An account of the portrait's subject and its painter, who turn out to be husband and wife, is included in the guidebook.The first, a well-known portrait painter, is a melancholy, passionate individual who is completely devoted to his work to the point where it appears as though he already has "a bride in his Art.""A maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee," according to the latter.Because she sees the artist's work as a rival for her husband's affections, the artist's wife despises nothing but his work.Even though she is happy, the girl is also humble and submissive. She follows her husband's wishes and is eager to have her portrait painted because she knows how much he appreciates his work.
When the painter begins working on the portrait, his wife's physical and mental health immediately begin to deteriorate, and her health and spirits "wither" as a result.
However, the artist misses this because he is too preoccupied with his work to notice his wife.She, on the other hand, doesn't whine.The girl continues to deteriorate as the painting nears completion and becomes ever more lifelike, almost as though her vital energy is being drawn into the canvas.The artist finally decides to look up at his wife as her image approaches perfection, only to discover that she has passed away.Understanding the text, respond to these inquiries.
a. From what location did the narrator and his servant forcefully enter?
In the Appennines of central Italy, the narrator and his servant Pedro forced their way into a desolate Chateau.The narrator sustained serious injuries.The narrator wasn't going to stay in an open-air area, his valet said.Without the narrator's consent, he forced the narrator into the Chateau.
b. Which unique picture in the room did the narrator notice?
When the candelabrum's rays struck the oval-shaped picture of a young girl in the room, the narrator noticed it.Before, the narrator didn't notice it.In that image, the young girl seemed to be maturing into a woman.The narrator was captivated by that woman's picture because it was so stunning.He was awake and very curious about the girl in the oval picture.In his serious state, he continued to read the portrait's history.He was completely absorbed in reading the book he had found in bed to learn more about its background.
c. Give a description of the portrait the narrator observed in the room.
The narrator saw a very artistic and lifelike portrait in the room.When the candelabrum's rays hit it, the narrator saw it.The representation was oval-formed
with a lovely image of a little kid on it.The frame had a lot of ornamentation.The young girl appeared to be maturing into a woman.The woman's shoulder and radiant hair-covered head seemed completely real to the narrator.The portrait's brushwork of tints appeared so lifelike.The narrator had a sudden urge to look at that picture.He opened his eyes after closing them once.He couldn't believe his eyes when he saw such amazing artistic talent.
d. How do the portrait painter and the subject interact with one another?
The portrait artist and the subject's relationship is that of a husband and wife.The subject (lady)'s husband is an enthusiastic artist who has painted her portrait.
He has Painted his wife&#39;s representation requiring numerous weeks.
      
Refer to the context a. What is the story's central theme?Who exactly is the woman in the oval portrait?
The main idea behind the short story "The Oval Portrait"is the connection between art and life.Art and love can be destructive, as this story has demonstrated.While love and art can help us achieve perfection, they can also have a negative impact on our lives.The story's painter has achieved success through his work, but his wife has suffered as a result of his efforts.She doesn't talk about her pain because she loves her husband so much.The story has shown terrible consequences of unnecessary energy
for something.The wife of the ardent painter who created the oval portrait is the woman depicted in it.
"The Oval Portrait" as a bis a brief horror novella written by Edgar Allan Poe about the ominous circumstances surrounding a portrait in a chateau.
Elaborate.
The desolate Chateau in the Appennines, a mountain range in central Italy, is the horrible and gloomy setting of this short story.In this story, the Chateau we see here is completely deserted and very old.Both the interior and the exterior appear to be awful.The Chateau's apartments are so filthy and poorly managed.
The narrator and his valet have a lot of decorative items in the apartment, but they're all falling apart.In one of the dark areas, the life-like portrait has been placed.Because everything is out of control, the lifelike portrait's surroundings are so upsetting.The environment also feels further apart as a result of the visitors' arrival.In the Chateau's desolate setting, the portrait appears to be of no use.
"The Oval Portrait" as a csuggests that the woman's beauty makes her destined for death.Discuss.
titled "The Oval Portrait"suggests that the woman will die because of her beauty.The painter's wife is so stunning and has just become a woman here.The artist wants to paint a portrait of her.He paints with a lot of passion and adores his work more than anything.He asks his wife to pose for him and places her on the chair.He is completely preoccupied with his artistic endeavors.It takes the Painter weeks to complete her portrait.He doesn't notice his wife's growing weakness while working on his task.He finds his wife dead on the chair after finishing the portrait.
d. Talk about the story as a frame narrative, which is like a story inside a story.
The literary technique known as the "frame narrative" tells a story within a story.It begins with a different story with a different plot and a different setting, but then it moves on to the next story within it.This technique demonstrates how a single story affects the next story.The story opens in a different setting and with different details about the narrator and his valet.At first, the readers follow along with the story, but then the next one begins with an amazing description of the oval portrait, its details, and background information.The story moves on to the next level for the readers.
Frame narrative depicts a single story and the subsequent story within it.
e. There is a lot of imagery and symbolism in the narrative, which is told in a descriptive style.What are some of the story's images and symbols?
There are a number of images and symbols in this story.In this story, which makes extensive use of both light and darkness, the author has skillfully used images to beautifully convey the horror elements he intends to convey.The audience has been drawn into a beginning thriller by the image of a desolate Chateau in the Appennines.In a similar vein, the image of two visitors in the pitch-black, desolate setting has piqued the reader's interest.The author used a lot of pictures inside the Chateau to show apartments, a torrent, and other locations.The oval painting, dark rooms, wall tapestries, trophies, candelabrum, book, rays of light, and other images can be found here.The artist and his wife were depicted in a high torrent of the Chateau in the oval portrait's historical context.This story is beautifully gothic thanks to the excellent use of images.The symbols, like the images, have also been crucial to comprehending this story on a deeper level.The oval portrait represents the immortality of art and love's passing away.The main subject of this portrait—the wife of the painter—has been taken from us.Her husband's passion for art took her life and made him immortal in his work, whereas her love for her husband led to her death.The time displayed in the artwork is the next symbol we see here.This point in the artist's work, when he has lost track of everything around him and caused his wife's death, represents the artist's obsession.
f. What does the phrase "She was dead!" mean?mean?
"The expression had passed away."signifies the shocking moment when the painter's wife died on the chair.The artist was extremely preoccupied with his work.He was completely focused on his painting task.He didn't check on his wife's health.For several weeks, he painted the portrait of his wife.He saw her dead posing on the chair when he turned his painting toward her happiness.The main subject of the artwork died in this instance.
Beyond the text: a. Do you believe that art has life?
I don't believe that art has life.Art is nothing more than a thing to show off that has meanings tied to a variety of things.However, artists literally bring life to art.They try to understand life through art.
b. The painting as a work of art is unrivaled in its admirability.Explain.
In regards to painting, this statement is absolutely accurate.The art of painting is truly admirable.The artists put in a lot of effort to create high-quality paintings with meaning.The painting itself uses its literal language to communicate.Painting gives us information about life.
The narrator was startled by the oval portrait in this story, which is one of the finest examples.When he sees that painting, he is completely perplexed.He wants to learn more about it and the artist.
c. The illusion is revealed by taking a closer look at the painting.Do you know of any such paintings?
Yes, I've seen such a painting.When a person who is passionate about art watches the painting, it becomes more meaningful.However, viewers who are unfamiliar with paintings frequently encounter illusion.In my case, I watched a typical painting for a long time without understanding its significance.I tried hard, but in vain, to understand its meaning.I later learned what it meant from my friend.

Because the child was a hardship, he or she provides a more interesting and effective point of view for the story than the narrator.He rises to every challenge and triumphs.His birthday present of a puppy inspired and encouraged him to travel further.He had the strength to finish his journey.He confronted every one of the difficulties, however he additionally won them as well.
f. Is the story of "The Wish" about greed or confidence triumphing over fear?Make your points.
titled "The Wish"The story is all about overcoming fear and having self-confidence.Because the child received a birthday present as encouragement for completing his journey or challenges, we can also interpret this story as a motivational tale.When the child looks at his scab, he seems afraid.He gives picking it a lot of thought.He asks himself a lot of questions.In his panic, he picks out his scab.However, when he sees the carpet, his fear rises significantly.He devises a strategy creatively.He gains self-assurance before shunning the subject.He imagines the colors as coals and snakes when he constructs his obstacles.He even shrugs off his objective.He bravely moves on to the carpet and wishes for a birthday present of a puppy.He makes every effort to get over his fear.He falls to the ground in black, ending both his self-assurance and his wish.
Beyond the text: a. Do you believe our wish can be realized?If not, why not?
Not all desires, wants, and goals are realized.To achieve our goals, aspirations, desires, and interests, we require laborious and intricate practice.Every choice we make should be made with calmness.Our desires and needs can only be satisfied by making the right choice.
A wish is when we long for something.Wishes can only be realized through hard work.However, none of our desires can be realized.Everyone is dissatisfied because their wish and desire are not realized, and when the wish does not materialize, they will be irritated.Almighty aids in every circumstance.
Therefore, we should practice a lot in order to satisfy our desires, needs, and satisfaction; only then can we be content.
b. Why do you think some people may have a terrifying personality?What would you advise them to do to get over it?
Because they lack self-confidence, some people may have a frightening nature.
To overcome it, I would suggest the following:
- Learn more about your fear; this may be the most difficult first step, but it is absolutely necessary.
- Make constructive use of your imagination.
- Think differently than you normally would.
Concentrate on your breathing.
- Engage in meditation.
- Work with nature as a therapist.
c. Compose a folktale that you have heard or perused.
Folklore (Nepalese:Dantya Katha) is a popular culture tale that is typically passed down orally.Write a story you've read or heard.

        title: 'God Sees the Truth but Waits',
        description: `
    Summary Aksyonov, a wealthy young merchant from the town of Vladimir, is getting ready to leave for the Nizhny commercial fair.The wife of Aksyonov tells him to go home because she had a bad dream in which his hair turned completely gray.Because he frequently drinks in large quantities, Aksyonov assumes that she is concerned that he will overindulge and dismisses her worries.He guarantees that he will
"be super useful business" at Nizhny and bring her back "costly presents."
Aksyonov meets a business associate on the way to Nizhny at an inn, where they have tea and spend the night in adjoining rooms.Aksyonov takes a break after leaving the hotel to rest, eat, and play his guitar on his way to Nizhny.A district police inspector and two soldiers suddenly show up, question Aksyonov about where he is and what he did the night before, and then say that Aksyonov's merchant friend has been found dead at the inn.A bloody knife is discovered during a search of Aksyonov's belongings by the police inspector.When the inspector makes the formal accusation that Aksyonov killed someone, the terrified Aksyonov mumbles and trembles.Aksyonov is taken into custody and physically restrained.
The wife of Aksyonov visits him in jail.When she sees her husband in shackles and prison clothes, she collapses.She shocks Aksyonov by asking whether he actually committed the murder for which he was arrested after she regains her senses and informs him that the last of his appeals, a petition to the Tsar, has been denied.As a soldier finally separates Aksyonov from his wife and children, he considers his wife's suspicions of his guilt and comes to the conclusion that he can only rely on God to know the truth and show mercy.
After being flogged, Aksyonov is taken to a Siberian labor camp.He stays here for 26 years, where he develops a stoop and loses his youthful enthusiasm.Aksyonov becomes extremely religious while incarcerated.He sings in the church choir, reads religious literature, and prays frequently.His fellow inmates refer to him as "Man of God" and "Grandpa."A new group of inmates arrives at the Siberian prison during Aksyonov's 26th year there.Makar Semyonov, one of them, has been sentenced to prison for allegedly stealing a horse from a sledge.Aksyonov inquires about his family and learns that he claims to be from Vladimir.According to Makar, he has heard that the Aksyonov family is wealthy merchants whose husband (or father) is imprisoned in Siberia.Makar inquires as to why Aksyonov was imprisoned, but Aksyonov responds only that his 26 years in prison have been paid for his sins.
Makar hears from other inmates about Aksyonov's wrongful arrest and the murder of the merchant.Aksyonov is led to believe that Makar was the one who set him up for murder based on Makar's response to this information.
Aksyonov is overcome with rage toward Makar and longs for his family.Aksyonov becomes so depressed that he thinks about killing himself or attacking Makar.
Aksyonov comes across Makar digging an escape tunnel one night.The following day, the specialists
find the opening, and the Lead representative shows up on the scene to scrutinize the detainees with respect to who was
attempting to get away.Aksyonov tells the Governor that he has no idea who dug the tunnel, reasoning that he does not want Makar to be flogged and that his suspicions about Makar's involvement in the merchant's death may be unfounded.Aksyonov wakes up the following night to find Makar seated at the foot of his bunk.Makar confesses to having framed Aksyonov for murder 26 years earlier and begs Aksyonov's forgiveness, overwhelmed by Aksyonov's goodness in protecting him from the Governor.In order to clear Aksyonov's name, Makar makes an offer to confess to the authorities.In anger, Aksyonov responds to Makar's confession by claiming that even if Makar helped him get out of prison, he would have no place to call home or family.However, Makar breaks down sobbing as he persists in pleading for Aksyonov's forgiveness.Aksyonov, too, breaks down in tears because he is moved by Makar's genuine guilt and pain.Makar is assured by Aksyonov that God will pardon him.Aksyonov no longer "pines" for his freedom or his family because he feels lighter.
In contrast, Aksyonov only considers his "last hour."Aksyonov is officially cleared after Makar tells the authorities that he was the one who killed the merchant, not Aksyonov.However, Aksyonov has already passed away by the time permission to release him from the labor camp is granted.

        id: 7,
        description: `
    The astrologer, the story's nameless protagonist, is actually a con artist rather than an astrologer.Every day, he sets up shop in a market under a tree, pretending to be a holy man with cosmic wisdom and wearing face paint.He listens to people's problems and offers what seems like wise advice for a small fee, dressing his common sense and manipulations in the language of an astrologist.
Even though he does not actually know anything about astrology, he is very observant and helps his customers by answering questions that make them feel good about themselves and clear their minds.It is uncovered toward the finish of
the story that the stargazer is secluded from everything, having escaped his home and previous existence as a rancher after he
shakily endeavored to kill Master Nayak.He knows for sure that he killed Guru Nayak, but the thought of killing him makes him feel very guilty.However, rather than feeling sorry for Guru Nayak, his burden is motivated by his own self-interest.The astrologer makes no effort to atone for his actions, even when he meets Guru Nayak.The astrologer is the main character, but he is not the story's hero.The astrologer has a wife and a child, but neither of them is aware of his past of murder.
Guru Nayak is the man the astrologer attempted to kill several years prior to the story's conclusion.Other than the fact that Guru Nayak has left his village and gone in search of the man who tried to kill him so that he can strangle him, very little is said about him.Guru Nayak is presented merely as a hostile newcomer who immediately expresses skepticism toward the astrologer and his alleged wisdom.Even though the astrologer is standing in front of him, he does not recognize his attacker because of the paint, turban, and long beard that he is wearing and the darkness of the evening.When the astrologer tells him the particulars of his attack and even Guru Nayak's own name, he eventually comes to believe that the astrologer is a prophet.He is frustrated when he is informed that his aggressor passed on under the
tires of a vehicle a few months prior, yet fulfilled sufficient that he vows to get back and never
dare to this town once more.Despite the fact that Guru Nayak is depicted as the story's antagonist, he could actually be viewed as the hero in the relationship between the two characters.Despite the fact that the story was written in English, Guru Nayak's name actually consists of two Hindi words:"Guru" refers to a spiritual guide or teacher, and "Nayak" refers to a hero.
The astrologer's wife, whose identity is only revealed at the story's conclusion, is pleased that her husband has earned more money than usual from his work.She is also shocked to learn that her husband had tried to kill Guru Nayak before they got married and left his village.
THEMES Mysticism and religious hypocrisy In his novel "An Astrologer's Day," Indian author R.K. Narayan tells the story of a dishonest astrologer who makes his living by selling villagers naive insights into the cosmos.Even though the astrologer has no real spiritual insight or knowledge of the cosmos, he takes advantage of his clients' search for meaning and comfort, burying his lies in the whims of religion and mystery.While Narayan's depiction of astrology and holy men does not denigrate religion, it certainly encourages it.The astrologer is presented as a normal man who, like any other human being, has problems with marriage, money, and tangled relationships. He is also full of greed and fear.He must borrow and fabricate cosmic insight because he lacks it.At the same time, the author is aware that such religious mysticism—real or imagined—offers a structure of meaning to ordinary people who face the same problems and, above all else, fear of insignificance and lack of control.
The astrologer's attire and equipment are all designed to exude power and mysticism in his appearance.The astrologer lays out his "professional equipment," which is nothing more than a number of cowrie shells, a cloth chart that is too obscure to understand but looks sufficiently mystical, and a bundle of ancient writings and scrolls, in the opening lines of the story.He sells the illusion that he is a holy man with these props;He never puts the items to use.The astrologer has also wrapped himself in a saffron turban and painted sacred ash on his forehead—ironically, saffron is a Hindu symbol for purity and the search for light.
The traditional image of holy men instructing their disciples under a grand tree, like Buddha attaining enlightenment or icons of Jesus Christ instructing his followers, is referenced by the astrologer as he sits himself beneath a large tamarind tree.He further reinforces the idea that he is a man connected to and in harmony with the world and the cosmos by associating himself with a magnificent piece of nature.However, the astrologer is fully aware that in such attire, "even a half-wit's eyes would sparkle" as his eyes, settled between the striking colors of his headgear and his black beard, take on a sharp, otherworldly quality that evokes powerful wisdom.In point of fact, the narrator makes the observation that "half the enchantment of the place had to do with the fact that it did not have the benefit of municipal lighting." This means that the marketplace itself only appears mystical because it does not have sufficient lighting that is provided by the government.These humorous details reject the astrologer's claim to be a true mystic and the outward manifestations of mysticism as meaningless and shallow.
As a result, the astrologer's lack of cosmic wisdom is concealed by his keen insight and religious vocabulary.The astrologer admits to himself that he never set out to become an astrologer and that he does not know the stars or planets as well as their astrological implications as well as any other peasant.The unfortunate circumstances that forced him to flee his home years earlier after (allegedly) killing another villager, Guru Nayak, are only the cause of his position as a fraudulent holy man, which is a risky endeavor in a highly religious community.Despite this, the astrologer has improved his perception and developed a comprehensive understanding of human issues, which almost always revolve around marriage, money, or tangled relationships.He is able to give ambiguous advice and positive affirmations disguised as astrological language because he has this insight and is good at listening.He now knows what people want to hear, even if they don't know they want it.They are pleased to pay him his fee because they are reassured by what he has to say.
Therefore, the astrologer's elaborate disguise is based on the fact that people are looking for meaning and are immediately inclined to give him credit.Strangely, the narrator believes that the astrologer is deserving of his wages and that his work is as honest as any man's.In point of fact, the astrologer serves as a kind of community therapist, though he isn't very good at it. However, he does encourage and reassure his patients during their difficulties.He fulfills his customers' desire for cosmic significance in some way;Their relationship is mutually beneficial.
However, he frequently makes absurd connections between their everyday problems and his astrological explanations, such as when he links a temperamental problem to Saturn's position.
The story's greatest hypocrisy is demonstrated by the fact that the astrologer uses his own disguise to evade punishment for a previous offense.The astrologer meets a skeptical stranger in the late hours of the night who he recognizes as Guru Nayak, the man he had tried to kill years earlier.The astrologer uses his guise as a religious man to convince the skeptic that his would-be murderer was killed months ago, putting an end to Guru Nayak's search for his assailant because he knows he will be killed if his identity is discovered.
FATE Narayan's world is primarily Hindu, and fate plays a significant role.Every action that a person takes has repercussions, and nothing happens by chance.The astrologer's guilt at stabbing another young man in the village and then running away to avoid punishment forms the basis of the entire narrative.Later, it becomes clear that the stabbing was a foolish act of youth.
Despite this, the astrologer lives with the fear of being found out, and it's odd that the victim is found out by him, not the other way around.He doesn't pay for what he did, but the story ends with him saying that he spent years regretting what he did, which is enough punishment on its own.
The narrative requires a suspension of disbelief, and if credibility is strained at certain points, it is due to the author's conception of fate that defies rational explanation.The way Narayan depicts fate does not lead to complacency, nor does it rule out the significance of individual actions.
However, there is a sense that human actions are part of a larger scheme.
  
Summary: In an unnamed Indian village, an astrologer displays his tools, which include cowrie shells, obscure charts, a notebook, and other oddities.They only serve to create the appearance of mysticism.The celestial prophet has likewise painted his temple with hallowed debris, wrapped his head
in a turban, and situated himself and his stuff underneath an enormous tree.Even though the narrator is quick to point out that none of these qualities actually belong to the man, all of these things serve to give him the appearance of wisdom, transcendence, and prophetic power.
The astrologer has set up shop in the middle of a crowded market where people are auctioning off low-quality fabrics, selling stolen goods, and serving the same cheap food as gourmet treats.The astrologer, who was quickly exposed as a conman, is with other con artists and spin doctors who are making a living by selling their products.The astrologer's mystical quality is enhanced by the dancing shadows cast by a variety of shop lights and flares that illuminate the market.It is notable that he does not own a light and simply borrows one from other vendors.
The astrologer had been forced to leave his ancestral home and travel several hundred miles away with no plan and no money despite having no intention of becoming one.Nonetheless, he is a convincing holy man who offers vague but comforting advice to market participants by utilizing his own insights into human issues.He acts like a therapist by giving self-affirming advice that he disguises as astrological advice.He is skilled in his field;He tells people what they want to hear, which makes them feel better when they leave.The astrologer earns a respectable living despite the fact that it is not honest.
Guru Nayak, a stranger, appears just as the market is empty and the lights are turned off.Neither can see much of the other person's face in the darkness.The astrologer invites Guru Nayak to sit and have a conversation because he sees an opportunity for one more client.The stranger does so, but the astrologer is immediately met with suspicion.He bets a lot that the astrologer won't be able to tell him anything useful or true.The astrologer agrees with their price haggling.But when Guru Nayak lights a cheroot, the astrologer is terrified when he sees the man's face for a moment.Guru Nayak holds him to the wager and refuses to let him leave, despite his attempts to exit.
Guru Nayak will not take the astrologer's usual tactic of vague, self-affirming advice.
After a brief period of sincere prayer, the astrologer alters course.He tells Guru Nayak that he is aware that he was stabbed in the chest, left for dead, and that Guru Nayak is now here looking for his attacker.He even admits that he knows Guru Nayak's name, a sign of his cosmic insight.Guru Nayak is overjoyed by everything because he believes the astrologer to be truly all-knowing.In order to exact his vengeance, he asks the astrologer to locate the man who stabbed him.He is informed by the astrologer that he was crushed to death by an approaching truck several months ago.Guru Nayak is dissatisfied by this, but at least his attacker suffered a terrible death.
He leaves after paying the astrologer.
The astrologer arrives home late at night and shows his wife the money he has earned. He becomes irritated for a moment when he realizes that Guru Nayak has paid him a significant sum, but not quite as much as he promised.Despite this, his wife is overjoyed.The astrologer tells his wife as they fall asleep that a significant weight has been lifted off of him.Guru Nayak was forced to flee his home and begin a new life as a con artist after the astrologer stabbed him and left him for dead years ago.He had believed he had killed someone, but now he was content that he hadn't actually killed anyone.He then goes to sleep, content.
A story's description helps readers imagine what happens.How does the author describe the astrologer? What specifics and strategies are used?
The astrologer is a formidable individual.The narrator asserts that if he had remained in his village, he would have continued his ancestors' legacy of cultivating the land, living there, marrying, and maturing in his cornfield and ancestral home.
But when he was forced to leave the village, he was able to use his intelligence to create a completely new persona and survive in an urban environment with a lot of people.According to the narrative, numerous rural dwellers may also possess a wide range of hidden talents if given the opportunity.The astrologer survives on his own two feet.Even though he is well aware that he does not possess any mystical knowledge, he is able to put on a show to entice onlookers and knows what to say to them.He probably does not know how to read or write.However, he possesses "street smarts," andquot;moxie.&quot;
He had a rough understanding of the problems facing humanity:money, marriage, and the web of human ties
His perception had been improved by prolonged practice.
He only takes small bills for his consultations, probably because most people who go for walks in the park for fun don't have much extra money to spend.It is evident that he must sit for extended periods of time to accumulate sufficient funds to sustain himself and his family on a daily basis.
...his eyes sparkled with a sharp abnormal gleam that was actually the result of a constant search for customers. However, his simple customers perceived it as a prophetic light and felt reassured.
In light of the precarious position he holds, money is very important to him.He is brave and determined in addition to his superior intelligence.The astrologer continues to insist on haggling over money even though he is interacting with Guru Nayak and his life is in imminent danger.In order to enable his wife to purchase food for the family, he brings every single coin home.He is clearly a devoted father and husband.
"The Day of the Astrologer"is a study of one kind of adaptation and the turbulences of life.If the astrologer had stayed in his village, he would have been an ignorant peasant. However, the big city forced him to adjust to completely new circumstances, and he was able to find a niche where he could live, marry, and have children.He has survived.We can identify with him because we all must learn to adapt to our surroundings in order to survive in this world.
Analyze "An Astrologer's Day's" conflicts.In the story "An Astrologer's Day," explain how the conflicts are resolved and what they reveal about the characters.by:R.K. Narayan is a novel-like short story with novel elements.Conflict is one of these elements.The problems that characters face throughout a story keep the plot moving are called conflict.Both internal and external conflicts, as well as the character's solution to them, are present throughout this narrative.The disagreements of "An Astrologer Day"allow us to delve deeply into the characters' lives and empathize with their struggles.
The Astrologer, the story's protagonist, is involved in one of the first conflicts."He had a working analysis of the problems that humanity was facing:"money, marriage, and the tangle of human ties.Because he doesn't bring any money home, the astrologer is having marital issues.People don't go to his tent or study because they think he's a hoax.Additionally, he has issues with the nearby vendors.This is an illustration of outside struggle against society and its battles.When Guru Nayak gives him enough faith to pay for a reading, the astrologer finally has a chance to settle the dispute.The astrologer leaves with the money after the reading, and his wife is overjoyed and says, "I can buy some jaggery and coconut tomorrow...now I will prepare some nice stuff."The Astrologer's problem has been somewhat alleviated at this point.This demonstrates that he was waiting for an opportunity to amass a fortune because he was not an actual astrologer.This shows that the astrologer is smart, committed, hopeful, patient, and knows how to take advantage of opportunities.
Guru Nayak, the other main character in this story, is involved in yet another conflict.When will I get my hands on him?Nayak discusses the adversary who attempted to kill him.Nayak wants to exact vengeance on the person who attacked him and learn who did it.Although he may occasionally experience internal conflict when his emotions become overwhelming, this is an external conflict.When the astrologer states, "He died four months ago in a far-off town," this conflict is resolved.He will never again be seen by you.This demonstrates that Guru Nayak is not a clever person because he uses a roadside astrologer to locate his attacker rather than providing the police with a physical description.He is a believer in fate and superstition.
Analysis (FOR EXTENDED KNOWLEDGE) Narayan vividly explains how the astrologer's appearance and tools give him a quasi-supernatural presence.Even though the author makes it clear that the astrologer is a con artist, it's easy to see how people could mistake him for more than just a man because of how convincingly he is described.Overselling their own value is a common practice among the vendors.The astrologer gives the impression of wisdom and power, while the food and cloth sellers give the impression of luxury.Each vendor exploits a desire for the luxuries of a more privileged life, catering to a poor population.Take note of the contrast between the Town Hall Park, which represents contemporary administration, and the astrologer, which represents ancient practice.
There are two reasons why the astrologer prefers indirect, possibly subpar lighting.It helps conceal the fact that he is not a genuine astrologer while also enhancing his mysticism.Despite this, the author empathizes with him because of the way he acts as a therapist, listening to his clients' problems and offering advice that may temporarily calm them.Even though the astrologer fled after attempting murder, this foreshadowing is dismissive, reflecting his current emotions regarding the situation. Later, it will be revealed that the astrologer fled.He appears to attribute his departure to chance.Nevertheless, he abandoned the only honest life he could have had.Albeit the crystal gazer has no old insight, he doesn't appear to require it.
Humanity's issues are the same as they have always been.It's possible that the clients of the astrologer only require a listening ear and a soothing voice to calm their nerves.The astrologer, on the other hand, knows that his clients want to appear to be in control and important, so he manipulates them to their mutual advantage.
The astrologer has successfully maintained his ruse for another day as the light dims.However, under the cover of darkness, he may now be more courageous than he should be.Ironically, the greed of the astrologer is what brings him to an encounter that almost costs him his life and his false identity.Given that light has throughout the narrative represented the illusion of cosmic wisdom, it is significant that the stranger blocks out the light;The skepticism of the stranger is reflected in the blocking of the light.The stranger, in stark contrast to the other characters in the story, is immediately suspicious of the astrologer's credibility, and he is right.Again, the astrologer's greed gets the better of him, and he keeps trying to get more money.
It is possible that the stranger—later revealed to be Guru Nayak, a man the astrologer thought he had killed—would have let him leave if the astrologer hadn't pushed the stakes so high. However, his self-interest has trapped him.He is now afraid for his own safety as well as the possibility of shedding his false identity, confronting his past, and feeling guilty.
The astrologer never even appears to consider taking responsibility for his crimes and being an honest man, despite being offered the chance to do so.He, on the other hand, uses his own experience to create a lie that is more convincing.Guru Nayak was close to forcing the astrologer to tell the truth and exposing him.Unfortunately, the astrologer misses his chance to live honestly.Worse still, he uses his previous relationship with Guru Nayak to permanently kill himself.The astrologer will never be able to match his accomplishments;He has executed his former self and satisfied Guru Nayak with dishonest justice.The astrologer's use of Guru Nayak's name suggests that they were fairly close friends.When the astrologer attempted to kill him, he was not a stranger, making the astrologer a fairly evil character.In addition to rejecting Guru Nayak's opportunity for confession, the astrologer issues what amounts to an astrological threat to abandon his search.The market has lost all light, and the astrologer's potential for virtue has also vanished.His wife's reaction to the money confirms that their family is extremely poor, despite earlier speculation.The astrologer is also rather petty for a holy man, blaming Guru Nayak for not having enough money rather than being grateful for his escape with his life.His wife is shocked when the astrologer tells her about a past wrongdoing, but he doesn't seem to know how serious it is.He goes to bed a completely liar and hypocrite man, content with the fact that he is not a true killer.He has ruined every opportunity for a genuine life.
