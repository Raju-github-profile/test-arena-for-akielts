%%•	What is the assignment you are supposed to finish?*
%%The goal is to match the paragraph's central idea to the ideas listed.
%%• Which abilities must you acquire?*
%%You must be able to comprehend the task's objective.
%%You must be able to distinguish between the paragraph's supporting idea and main idea.
%%You must be able to comprehend the section's and paragraph's main idea.
%%• TIPS*:%% Before reading the paragraph, always read the headings carefully.
%%The majority of the time, there are more headings than paragraph numbers.
%%Before attempting to match the headings with the paragraphs, always conduct an analysis.
 %%Before answering, read the instructions because answers frequently consist of numbers (i,ii,iii...).
%%Despite the fact that you will be searching in paragraph sequence for answers, the list from which you select your responses does not follow the paragraph's order.
%%Avoid reading too quickly.Due to limited time, some teachers suggest that students simply "skim" the text.In my experience, this causes students to make mistakes and not comprehend the majority of the text.It is preferable to proceed with caution and actually comprehend what is in front of you.
%%Last but not least, almost ninety percent of the time, the responses are in the paragraph's topic sentence or its conclusion.
%%Last but not least, the majority of Nepalese students find this question to be the most challenging. If you find it challenging, leave it and try solving other questions first, then come back to this type of question later.`

        %%%%%%• What are your responsibilities?*
%%You are expected to determine whether the information or author's opinion provided in the question matches, does not match, or does not contain any information or opinion.
%%%%%%• What are the meanings of "TRUE," "YES," and "NO"?*
%%If the question asks you to write "true," this indicates that you are looking for the information that the author wishes to provide and that absolutely corresponds to the statement in the question.
%%If the question asks you to write YES, you are looking for the writer's opinion that is consistent with the question's opinion in every way.
%%If the question asks you to write "FALSE," this indicates that you are seeking information that is in complete opposition to the statement made in the question.
%%If the question asks you to write "NO," that means you are looking for the writer's opinion that is completely different from what is asked.
%%If you are asked to write "Not Given," the passage does not contain the information or opinion provided in the question.
%%%%%%• TIPS*:%% When you try to solve questions of this kind, always look for synonyms or paraphrases.
%%Since there are so many traps, we can say that this is not a difficult question but rather a confusing one.
%%When you see a qualifier like "most," "only," "somewhat," "everything," "sometimes," "usually," and so on, be careful.because using these words could cause you to give the wrong answer.
%%The responses come in that order.That is to say, the answer to question number one can be found in line 4 of paragraph number 2, but the answer to question number two cannot be found in paragraph number one.
 %%If you already know a lot about the subject, ignore it and only respond based on the text; don't make any assumptions.
%%There will be at least one response from each of the three.You have at least one incorrect answer if you don't have at least one "true," "false," or "not given" response.
 %%Be careful when you see verbs like "suggest," "claim," "believe," and "know" that qualify statements."The man claimed he was a British citizen," for instance, and "The man is a British citizen" are not the same thing.
%%Don't look for words that exactly match what's said.You ought to look for synonyms as well.Keep in mind that you're matching meaning rather than words.
%%Put "not given" if you are unsure of the response.Since the answer is absent, you probably do not know.
%%If you wrote NG as the answer to the second question, you shouldn't forget it because the answers to these kinds of questions come in a particular order. Once you find the answer to the next question, you can only confirm that the previous answer wasn't given because you didn't find the answer between the first and third questions.
