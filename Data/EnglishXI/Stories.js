%%The narrative begins with the children playing every afternoon after returning from school in the Giant's garden.The garden was lovely, big, and had fruit trees and soft grass.Birds sat on the luscious fruit trees and sang sweetly.
%%After seven years, the giant returned one day.The Cornish Ogre, his friend, was staying with him.When they saw him, the kids were afraid.He declared that he would not permit anyone to play here because it was his own garden after observing the children playing.He added a notice board and erected a wall around it."Trespassers will be prosecuted" was the warning that was displayed on the notice board.
%%As they had no other place to play, the children became depressed.As they walked around the garden's high walls, they would think of the lovely garden that was inside them.
%%The season of spring arrived, and everywhere there were blossoms and tiny birds.However, the giant's garden was covered in frost and snow because it was winter.Birds also did not sing when there were no children around.A flower once bloomed, but when it saw the sign, it went back to sleep.The hailstorm and the North Wind followed.The giant's selfishness prevented the golden autumn fruits from reaching his garden as well.
%%The giant then awoke to the sound of sweet music.Outside his window, a linnet was singing.He could feel the spring as the hail and the North Wind stopped.He noticed that the children had entered his garden through a small opening.The blossoming trees were visible as the children sat on tree branches.He likewise saw the birds flying and hear
them trilling.The blossoms had also emerged.
%%However, to his surprise, winter was still present elsewhere.He noticed that a young boy was standing there, unable to reach the trees' branches.He was still unable to climb despite the tree lowering its branches.
%%His heart broke when he saw this scene.He realized he was truly very self-centered.He made the decision to remove the walls, put that boy on top of the tree, and let children play here forever.However, when the children saw him, they fled, and the garden went back into winter.However, despite his weeping, that youngster did not flee.He was placed on top of the tree by the giant, and the tree immediately blossomed.He gave the giant a kiss.
%%Realizing that the giant is not evil, the other children returned.They returned with the spring.Every afternoon, the giant used to play with the kids, but that little boy wasn't there.He became extremely weak over time.He saw a lovely tree in a corner with white blossoms one winter morning.The young boy stood beneath the tree, which had golden branches.
%%The giant was furious because the boy had been injured.He promised the boy that he would kill the person who had hurt him.He was informed by the boy that these were love's wounds.The boy asked the giant to visit his garden with a smile.Later, the children discovered the enormous corpse beneath the white blossom-covered tree.
       
%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*%%a. *Where did the kids play in the past?*%%%%After school in the afternoon, the children used to play in the magnificent giant's garden.
%%b. How did the garden get affected by the Frost and the Snow?*%%The two agents who showed up in the giant's garden after the giant acted rudely toward the children were the snow and the frost.The great white cloak of the Snow covered the grass, and the silver paint on the trees was done by the Frost.Even the North Wind was invited to stay with them.
%%c. When the giant was awake in bed, what did he hear?*%%While the giant was still asleep in bed, he could hear the sweet song of a tiny linnet bird.He waited some time before hearing the music.
%%d. Why do you think the giant's garden never experienced spring?*%%I believe that the children and the springtime season also became depressed.She became so enraged that she never went to the giant's garden to discover the giant's rudeness and selfishness toward the children.
%%e. In what manner did the giant realize his error?*%%When the giant noticed strange changes in his garden, he realized what he had done wrong.He learned that there was snow, frost, north wind, fog, and other things.in his backyard.He felt bad about himself for all the things he had done to the kids.At the point when the youngsters returned in his nursery, the
%%Once more nursery sprouted with leaves and blossoms.Even in his garden, he could hear the chirping of birds.He realized his error as a result.

%%Reference to the context*%% A. *Read the following excerpts and respond to the questions.%%a. *"How content we were there!"They spoke to one another.i. To what location does "there" refer?*%% 
%%➜  '  There '  refers to the giant's garden, which served as a play area for children after school.
%%ii.What is meant by "they"?*%%* 
%%➜  '  They '  refers to the kids who used to come to Giant's garden after school to play.
%%iii.Why do they assert this?*%%*They say this because they are no longer permitted to play in the giant's garden.
%%In rage, the giant has driven them out of his garden.
%%b. He stated, "I have many beautiful flowers;"However, the children are the most exquisite flowers.Is there a speaker?*%%*
%%➜ The speaker is an old and weak goliath who continues to watch the kids at their play
sitting on his easy chair.
%%ii.Who is he addressing?*%%He is talking to himself while taking in his garden.
%%iii.Who exactly are "the children" referred to by the speaker?*%%"The Children" is the title.The young, innocent schoolchildren that the speaker is referring to are those who spend a lot of time having fun in the giant's garden.
%%iv.Why is it stated that "the children are the most beautiful flowers of all" by the speaker?*%%*
%%"The children are the most beautiful flowers of all," the speaker declares.because he has witnessed children playing in his garden.He has observed their innocence and simplicity.He believes that the children are a gift from nature, and their presence has contributed to the garden's stunning appearance and abundance of blossoms and leaves.Because he is aware that the value of children in his garden is greater than that of flowers, he makes the comparison here to value children highly.
%%c. *When the young child said to the Giant, "You let me play once in your garden, today you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise," he smiled at him.The contented giant passes away shortly thereafter.How did this occur at the same time?*%%In relation to this fairy tale, describe it.

%%B. *Personification is one of the main speech figures in the story.Three instances of personification from the story should be cited.What significance does the story place on the personification of the seasons?*%%The writer has used a figure of speech perfectly in this instance.The Snow, the Frost, and the North Wind are the three examples of personification.The fact that the story's personified seasons are connected to nature and play a crucial role in transforming the giant's garden into a unique weapon against evil deeds is what makes them significant.
%%C. *The children, the seasons, the tree, the corner of the garden, the snow, the wind, and the frost are all used as symbols in this fairytale.Make sense of those symbols.
%%Here, the springtime is associated with happiness, while the wintertime is associated with suffering.The child's identification with Christ is represented by the tree.The side of the nursery
represents the hallowed spot of God from where reclamation is conceivable.The frost, wind, and snow all represent a singular force against evil.
%%D. *The expression "winter, frost, snow, north wind, hail, and little child" comes from which figure of speech?*%%Who is compared to the young child?*%%
%%The best use of personification can be found in this brief story.Frost, snow, north wind, hail, and a young child have all been wonderfully personified in this location.Winter, frost, and snow are three of these that have been personified as feminine with particular force.They have completed their tasks in opposition to the giant's actions.Men with power have been portrayed as the north wind, hail, and young child.
%%The young child is compared to "Lord Jesus," the Chrisitan God.in this narrative.This young child has been given divine powers that have the ability to alter everything.The garden has blossomed with beautiful flowers and leaves as a result of his presence.The child's two nails on his feet and palms have brought to mind the crucifixion of Lord Jesus.
%%Reference outside of the text *%%a. *What is the story's main idea?*%%This story has a number of themes, including arrogance, the negative effects of selfishness, love and compassion, the idea of salvation, and so on.While bad deeds are always punished, good deeds are always rewarded.Here, all we see is the giant's arrogance and selfishness toward the children, both of which have hurt him.But because of his good deeds, he has a good place to go outside.
%%b. Does God reprimand those who are cruel to children and incredibly self-centered?*%%*
%%Yes, God punishes cruel people and those who are very self-centered.Children are meant to be very innocent and God's babies.They are known for being straightforward.Their presence is a positive sign.We can get a fine model from this tale about God '  s discipline to
the monster.He feels bad about himself for doing bad things.

        description: `
        %%Summary:*%% At the beginning of "The Oval Portrait," the unnamed narrator and his servant Pedro "forcefully enter" an abandoned chateau in the Apennines.The narrator is severely injured, slightly delirious, and unable to spend the night outdoors for reasons that are never explained.The two men hide in a faraway bed room with "rich, yet tattered and antique" decorations.Due to the "bizarre architecture" of the chateau, this room has an odd shape and many nooks.The chamber
brags a number embroidered works of art, "armorial prizes," and "a bizarrely incredible number of
exceptionally lively current compositions in edges of rich brilliant arabesque."The narrator is interested in the paintings.He tells Pedro to light a tall candelabrum at the foot of the bed because he wants to think about them.A small book with an overview of the room's pictures is also found on his pillow.
%%The narrator is completely absorbed as she looks at the paintings and reads this guidebook while Pedro is sleeping, until finally the clock strikes midnight.He moves the candelabrum to bring more light to the book because he is unhappy with its position. As he does so, he notices a painting that he had not previously noticed.It depicts a young woman who is "just ripening into womanhood."The narrator is forced to temporarily close his eyes and wonder exactly what it is about the image that he finds so startling that it has such an overwhelming yet ambiguous effect on him.
%%The portrait is briefly described by the narrator."Much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully," it is a "vignette" painted.The girl's head and shoulders are shown, but the rest of her body is hidden.The execution of the painting and the beauty of its subject are both admired by the narrator, but the painting's absolute lifelikeness, which "confounds," "subdues," and "appalls" him, truly astonishes the narrator.Before returning the candelabrum to its previous position and turning to the relevant guidebook description, he spends an hour immersed in the portrait.
%%An account of the portrait's subject and its painter, who turn out to be husband and wife, is included in the guidebook.The first, a well-known portrait painter, is a melancholy, passionate individual who is completely devoted to his work to the point where it appears as though he already has "a bride in his Art.""A maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee," according to the latter.Because she sees the artist's work as a rival for her husband's affections, the artist's wife despises nothing but his work.Even though she is happy, the girl is also humble and submissive. She follows her husband's wishes and is eager to have her portrait painted because she knows how much he appreciates his work.
%%When the painter begins working on the portrait, his wife's physical and mental health immediately begin to deteriorate, and her health and spirits "wither" as a result.
%%However, the artist misses this because he is too preoccupied with his work to notice his wife.She, on the other hand, doesn't whine.The girl continues to deteriorate as the painting nears completion and becomes ever more lifelike, almost as though her vital energy is being drawn into the canvas.The artist finally decides to look up at his wife as her image approaches perfection, only to discover that she has passed away.
%%*Understanding the text, respond to these inquiries.
%%a. From what location did the narrator and his servant forcefully enter?*%%
%%In the Appennines of central Italy, the narrator and his servant Pedro forced their way into a desolate Chateau.The narrator sustained serious injuries.The narrator wasn't going to stay in an open-air area, his valet said.Without the narrator's consent, he forced the narrator into the Chateau.
%%b. Which unique picture in the room did the narrator notice?*%%
%%When the candelabrum's rays struck the oval-shaped picture of a young girl in the room, the narrator noticed it.Before, the narrator didn't notice it.In that image, the young girl seemed to be maturing into a woman.The narrator was captivated by that woman's picture because it was so stunning.He was awake and very curious about the girl in the oval picture.In his serious state, he continued to read the portrait's history.He was completely absorbed in reading the book he had found in bed to learn more about its background.
%%c. Give a description of the portrait the narrator observed in the room.*
%%The narrator saw a very artistic and lifelike portrait in the room.When the candelabrum's rays hit it, the narrator saw it.The representation was oval-formed
with a lovely image of a little kid on it.The frame had a lot of ornamentation.The young girl appeared to be maturing into a woman.The woman's shoulder and radiant hair-covered head seemed completely real to the narrator.The portrait's brushwork of tints appeared so lifelike.The narrator had a sudden urge to look at that picture.He opened his eyes after closing them once.He couldn't believe his eyes when he saw such amazing artistic talent.
%%d. How do the portrait painter and the subject interact with one another?*
%%The portrait artist and the subject's relationship is that of a husband and wife.The subject (lady)'s husband is an enthusiastic artist who has painted her portrait.
%%He has Painted his wife '  s representation requiring numerous weeks.
%%*Refer to the context%% a. What is the story's central theme?Who exactly is the woman in the oval portrait?*%%
%%he main idea behind the short story "The Oval Portrait"is the connection between art and life.Art and love can be destructive, as this story has demonstrated.While love and art can help us achieve perfection, they can also have a negative impact on our lives.The story's painter has achieved success through his work, but his wife has suffered as a result of his efforts.She doesn't talk about her pain because she loves her husband so much.The story has shown terrible consequences of unnecessary energy
for something.The wife of the ardent painter who created the oval portrait is the woman depicted in it.
%%b."The Oval Portrait" as a bis a brief horror novella written by Edgar Allan Poe about the ominous circumstances surrounding a portrait in a chateau.
Elaborate.*
%%The desolate Chateau in the Appennines, a mountain range in central Italy, is the horrible and gloomy setting of this short story.In this story, the Chateau we see here is completely deserted and very old.Both the interior and the exterior appear to be awful.The Chateau's apartments are so filthy and poorly managed.
%%The narrator and his valet have a lot of decorative items in the apartment, but they're all falling apart.In one of the dark areas, the life-like portrait has been placed.Because everything is out of control, the lifelike portrait's surroundings are so upsetting.The environment also feels further apart as a result of the visitors' arrival.In the Chateau's desolate setting, the portrait appears to be of no use.
%%c."The Oval Portrait" as a csuggests that the woman's beauty makes her destined for death.Discuss.*
%%"The Oval Portrait"suggests that the woman will die because of her beauty.The painter's wife is so stunning and has just become a woman here.The artist wants to paint a portrait of her.He paints with a lot of passion and adores his work more than anything.He asks his wife to pose for him and places her on the chair.He is completely preoccupied with his artistic endeavors.It takes the Painter weeks to complete her portrait.He doesn't notice his wife's growing weakness while working on his task.He finds his wife dead on the chair after finishing the portrait.
%%d. Talk about the story as a frame narrative, which is like a story inside a story.*
%%The literary technique known as the "frame narrative" tells a story within a story.It begins with a different story with a different plot and a different setting, but then it moves on to the next story within it.This technique demonstrates how a single story affects the next story.The story opens in a different setting and with different details about the narrator and his valet.At first, the readers follow along with the story, but then the next one begins with an amazing description of the oval portrait, its details, and background information.The story moves on to the next level for the readers.
Frame narrative depicts a single story and the subsequent story within it.
%%e. There is a lot of imagery and symbolism in the narrative, which is told in a descriptive style.What are some of the story's images and symbols?*%%
%%There are a number of images and symbols in this story.In this story, which makes extensive use of both light and darkness, the author has skillfully used images to beautifully convey the horror elements he intends to convey.The audience has been drawn into a beginning thriller by the image of a desolate Chateau in the Appennines.In a similar vein, the image of two visitors in the pitch-black, desolate setting has piqued the reader's interest.The author used a lot of pictures inside the Chateau to show apartments, a torrent, and other locations.The oval painting, dark rooms, wall tapestries, trophies, candelabrum, book, rays of light, and other images can be found here.The artist and his wife were depicted in a high torrent of the Chateau in the oval portrait's historical context.This story is beautifully gothic thanks to the excellent use of images.The symbols, like the images, have also been crucial to comprehending this story on a deeper level.The oval portrait represents the immortality of art and love's passing away.The main subject of this portrait—the wife of the painter—has been taken from us.Her husband's passion for art took her life and made him immortal in his work, whereas her love for her husband led to her death.The time displayed in the artwork is the next symbol we see here.This point in the artist's work, when he has lost track of everything around him and caused his wife's death, represents the artist's obsession.
%%f. What does the phrase "She was dead!" mean?*%%
"The expression had passed away."signifies the shocking moment when the painter's wife died on the chair.The artist was extremely preoccupied with his work.He was completely focused on his painting task.He didn't check on his wife's health.For several weeks, he painted the portrait of his wife.He saw her dead posing on the chair when he turned his painting toward her happiness.The main subject of the artwork died in this instance.
%%*Beyond the text:%% a. Do you believe that art has life?*%%
%%I don't believe that art has life.Art is nothing more than a thing to show off that has meanings tied to a variety of things.However, artists literally bring life to art.They try to understand life through art.
%%b. The painting as a work of art is unrivaled in its admirability.Explain.
%%In regards to painting, this statement is absolutely accurate.The art of painting is truly admirable.The artists put in a lot of effort to create high-quality paintings with meaning.The painting itself uses its literal language to communicate.Painting gives us information about life.
%%The narrator was startled by the oval portrait in this story, which is one of the finest examples.When he sees that painting, he is completely perplexed.He wants to learn more about it and the artist.
%%c. The illusion is revealed by taking a closer look at the painting.Do you know of any such paintings?*%%
Yes, I've seen such a painting.When a person who is passionate about art watches the painting, it becomes more meaningful.However, viewers who are unfamiliar with paintings frequently encounter illusion.In my case, I watched a typical painting for a long time without understanding its significance.I tried hard, but in vain, to understand its meaning.I later learned what it meant from my friend.

        Summary %%Aksyonov, a wealthy young merchant from the town of Vladimir, is getting ready to leave for the Nizhny commercial fair.The wife of Aksyonov tells him to go home because she had a bad dream in which his hair turned completely gray.Because he frequently drinks in large quantities, Aksyonov assumes that she is concerned that he will overindulge and dismisses her worries.He guarantees that he will
    "be super useful business" at Nizhny and bring her back "costly presents."
    %%Aksyonov meets a business associate on the way to Nizhny at an inn, where they have tea and spend the night in adjoining rooms.Aksyonov takes a break after leaving the hotel to rest, eat, and play his guitar on his way to Nizhny.A district police inspector and two soldiers suddenly show up, question Aksyonov about where he is and what he did the night before, and then say that Aksyonov's merchant friend has been found dead at the inn.A bloody knife is discovered during a search of Aksyonov's belongings by the police inspector.When the inspector makes the formal accusation that Aksyonov killed someone, the terrified Aksyonov mumbles and trembles.Aksyonov is taken into custody and physically restrained.
    %%The wife of Aksyonov visits him in jail.When she sees her husband in shackles and prison clothes, she collapses.She shocks Aksyonov by asking whether he actually committed the murder for which he was arrested after she regains her senses and informs him that the last of his appeals, a petition to the Tsar, has been denied.As a soldier finally separates Aksyonov from his wife and children, he considers his wife's suspicions of his guilt and comes to the conclusion that he can only rely on God to know the truth and show mercy.
    %%After being flogged, Aksyonov is taken to a Siberian labor camp.He stays here for 26 years, where he develops a stoop and loses his youthful enthusiasm.Aksyonov becomes extremely religious while incarcerated.He sings in the church choir, reads religious literature, and prays frequently.His fellow inmates refer to him as "Man of God" and "Grandpa."A new group of inmates arrives at the Siberian prison during Aksyonov's 26th year there.Makar Semyonov, one of them, has been sentenced to prison for allegedly stealing a horse from a sledge.Aksyonov inquires about his family and learns that he claims to be from Vladimir.According to Makar, he has heard that the Aksyonov family is wealthy merchants whose husband (or father) is imprisoned in Siberia.Makar inquires as to why Aksyonov was imprisoned, but Aksyonov responds only that his 26 years in prison have been paid for his sins.
    %%Makar hears from other inmates about Aksyonov's wrongful arrest and the murder of the merchant.Aksyonov is led to believe that Makar was the one who set him up for murder based on Makar's response to this information.
    %%Aksyonov is overcome with rage toward Makar and longs for his family.Aksyonov becomes so depressed that he thinks about killing himself or attacking Makar.
   %% Aksyonov comes across Makar digging an escape tunnel one night.The following day, the specialists
   %% %%find the opening, and the Lead representative shows up on the scene to scrutinize the detainees with respect to who was
    attempting to get away.Aksyonov tells the Governor that he has no idea who dug the tunnel, reasoning that he does not want Makar to be flogged and that his suspicions about Makar's involvement in the merchant's death may be unfounded.Aksyonov wakes up the following night to find Makar seated at the foot of his bunk.Makar confesses to having framed Aksyonov for murder 26 years earlier and begs Aksyonov's forgiveness, overwhelmed by Aksyonov's goodness in protecting him from the Governor.In order to clear Aksyonov's name, Makar makes an offer to confess to the authorities.In anger, Aksyonov responds to Makar's confession by claiming that even if Makar helped him get out of prison, he would have no place to call home or family.However, Makar breaks down sobbing as he persists in pleading for Aksyonov's forgiveness.Aksyonov, too, breaks down in tears because he is moved by Makar's genuine guilt and pain.Makar is assured by Aksyonov that God will pardon him.Aksyonov no longer "pines" for his freedom or his family because he feels lighter.
    %%In contrast, Aksyonov only considers his "last hour."Aksyonov is officially cleared after Makar tells the authorities that he was the one who killed the merchant, not Aksyonov.However, Aksyonov has already passed away by the time permission to release him from the labor camp is granted.

        Summary:%% The narrative begins with a young child removing a scab from his knee.He notices the extensive red, black, and yellow carpet that leads to the front door as he sits on the stairs.He decides that the black areas are deadly poisonous snakes that will sting him and kill him, while the red areas are scorching coal that will completely consume him.He will get a puppy for his birthday tomorrow if he manages to cross without being bitten or burned.
    %%The youngster starts his quest.The first part is easy, but he has to take long strides to reach some difficult parts.
    %%He stumbles, but tries to stay upright by extending his arms.Despite the fact that it appears to be more challenging, there is less black on the left, so he turns to the left.He is extremely wary of the snakes.)He realizes he can't turn around or jump off when he reaches the halfway point.His chest begins to tighten with panic.His foot is just a centimeter away from a black patch as he takes another step toward the one yellow piece that is close by.In order to observe him, a snake moves and raises its head.I won't touch you!I won't bite you!He ponders.The child remains terrified for several minutes as yet another snake rises.The subsequent step is too lengthy to jump.The child transfers his weight after crossing with one foot.He then tries to raise his back foot, but fails.He was stuck while doing the splits.The greasy snakes' writhing bodies below him caught his eye as he looked down.He started to sway, but this time waving his arms just made the problem worse.He was beginning to go over. "The next thing he saw was his naked hand slamming into a massive black mass with gleaming precision, prompting a piercing scream.The mother was looking for her son far behind the house, in the sun.
   %% Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.
   %% a. What did the child do to his knee scab?*%%
   %% At first, the child examined the scab on his knee cap.After much deliberation, he decided to pick it up.
   %% He applied that scab to his thigh by gently picking it up with his fingernail.He finally turned it over with his finger.
   %% b. In what way did the child react to the carpet?*%%
    %%The child is astonished when she sees the red carpet.He had never really noticed it in this way before.The carpet's various hues appeared to gleam at him in a most dazzling way as they mysteriously lit up.His imagination and those colors completely lost him.
   %% c. When he was walking across the carpet, what was he afraid of?*%%
    %%He was afraid of the carpet's black and red spots as he moved across the floor.
   %% In his head, he imagined the carpet's colors to be distinct things.He interpreted the black spots as black poisonous snakes and the red spots as lumps of burning coal.On his journey, he was bitten by burning coals and poisonous snakes out of fear of being consumed.As a result, he walked cautiously only on yellow spots that he thought were safe.
   %% d. What inspired the child to begin and continue his journey?*%%
   %% The child's desire to receive a puppy as a birthday present or as a birthday present motivated and encouraged him to begin and continue his journey.
    %%e. When the child looked down at the carpet's black patterns, what did he see?*%%
    %%The child observed a mysterious brightening of various colors.He was lost among the various hues.
    spots.In his mind, he kept thinking about the various colors and their shapes.So, as the child looked down at the black patterns on the carpet, he saw the poisonous snake with its oily body emerging to catch or bite him.
      
    
   %% a. The story is told in two different voices by the author.What are they?*%%
   %% Yes, there are two voices in the story—one from the narrator and one from the young boy, also known as the child.
   %% b. Read the following excerpts and respond to the questions.If I touch one of the black parts, I will be bitten and die before tea time—mostly adders and cobras, which are poisonous. If I touch one of them, I will die before tea time.Additionally, if I successfully cross without being bitten or burned, I will receive a puppy for my birthday tomorrow.
    %%i. What does it mean to say "the black part?*%%"
    %%The journey's difficulties, obstacles, and suffering are referred to as the "black path."
    %%ii.Who is speaking?*%%
   %% The child was the young man who spoke.
   %% iii.Why does the speaker not desire to burn?*%%
   %% The speaker wants to get a puppy as a birthday present tomorrow, so he doesn't want to burn.
   %% c. In the narrative, what images and metaphors are utilized?*%%
    • Images:
   %% i. Scab (the boy's knee).
   %% It is a representation of the boy's curiosity, desire, and interest in continuing his journey.
   %% ii.Parts of the carpet that are black
  %%  It depicts difficulties, suffering, and life's unsettling circumstances.
   %% iii.Read Patches (Fire)—it depicts fire as a danger because it has the potential to burn a young child.
     
   %% iv.Yellow patches (happiness): In his life, the yellow patches on the carpet symbolize relief, pleasure, optimism, happiness, and self-confidence.
   %% Metaphors:%%
   %% A disagreement in his life is symbolized by the carpet.It's possible that he won't be able to make the right choice.If we make the wrong choice, we may suffer greatly.We won't experience any difficulties in our lives if we choose the right option because it will take us down the right road.Otherwise, if we make the wrong choice or follow the wrong path at the wrong time, we will suffer.
   %% e. The narrative depicts the events through the perspectives of the child and the narrator.Contrasting
    the two styles, who presents a really fascinating or powerful view for the perusers?*%%Why?*%%
   %% Because the child was a hardship, he or she provides a more interesting and effective point of view for the story than the narrator.He rises to every challenge and triumphs.His birthday present of a puppy inspired and encouraged him to travel further.He had the strength to finish his journey.He confronted every one of the difficulties, however he additionally won them as well.
   %% f. Is the story of "The Wish" about greed or confidence triumphing over fear?*%%Make your points.
    titled "The Wish"The story is all about overcoming fear and having self-confidence.Because the child received a birthday present as encouragement for completing his journey or challenges, we can also interpret this story as a motivational tale.When the child looks at his scab, he seems afraid.He gives picking it a lot of thought.He asks himself a lot of questions.In his panic, he picks out his scab.However, when he sees the carpet, his fear rises significantly.He devises a strategy creatively.He gains self-assurance before shunning the subject.He imagines the colors as coals and snakes when he constructs his obstacles.He even shrugs off his objective.He bravely moves on to the carpet and wishes for a birthday present of a puppy.He makes every effort to get over his fear.He falls to the ground in black, ending both his self-assurance and his wish.
   %% Beyond the text: a. Do you believe our wish can be realized?*%%If not, why not?*%%
   %% Not all desires, wants, and goals are realized.To achieve our goals, aspirations, desires, and interests, we require laborious and intricate practice.Every choice we make should be made with calmness.Our desires and needs can only be satisfied by making the right choice.
   %% A wish is when we long for something.Wishes can only be realized through hard work.However, none of our desires can be realized.Everyone is dissatisfied because their wish and desire are not realized, and when the wish does not materialize, they will be irritated.Almighty aids in every circumstance.
   %% Therefore, we should practice a lot in order to satisfy our desires, needs, and satisfaction; only then can we be content.
   %% b. Why do you think some people may have a terrifying personality?*%%What would you advise them to do to get over it?*%%
   %% Because they lack self-confidence, some people may have a frightening nature.
   %% To overcome it, I would suggest the following:
    %%- Learn more about your fear; this may be the most difficult first step, but it is absolutely necessary.
    %%- Make constructive use of your imagination.
    %%- Think differently than you normally would.
   %% Concentrate on your breathing.
   %% - Engage in meditation.
   %% - Work with nature as a therapist.
   %% c. Compose a folktale that you have heard or perused.
   %% Folklore (Nepalese:Dantya Katha) is a popular culture tale that is typically passed down orally.Write a story you've read or heard.

        %%Analysis of Characters*%% Jonathan Iwengbu*%% is the story's main character.In addition, he is portrayed as a positive, hardworking, and resilient character.He doesn't think about the loss he suffered during the war.Instead, he makes amends and begins working toward his future.
%%In the story, he lost his son in the war, but in spite of that irreversible loss, he celebrates the things he has left, like his wife and the three children he has left.He also starts several businesses to provide for his family.
%%MARIA IWEGBU*%% She is Jonathan Iwegbu's wife.She is a loving and devoted spouse.In addition, she embodies the story's resilience and perseverance.She began baking cakes for neighbors after the war to make some money and help her husband.She doesn't cry over her loss after being robbed; rather, she stays focused on her work.
%%He is in charge of robbery. THIEF LEADERHe boldly declares himself a thief when he knocks on Jonathan's door.
%%He is portrayed as self-assured and arrogant.In addition, he mocks Jonathan's family's helplessness.
%%Instead, when neighbors do not respond, he yells for the police and soldiers to arrive.His speech reveals his lack of literacy.Additionally, he demonstrates the constant threat in postwar times.
%%THE Military Official*%%
%%He ordered Jonathan's bicycle for some tactical reason.However, Jonathan bribes him with money rather than lending him his bike, which he accepts.
%%In the story, the army officer exhibits unreliability and lack of rule.
%%The group of five robbers who accompany the thief leader is known as the THIEF CHORUS.Their task is to produce chanting responses to the questions and decisions posed by their leader.
%%The chorus raises objections at one point to the leader's decision to receive twenty pounds rather than one hundred.The leader turns down the chorus's requests to enter and rummage for more money.
%%THEMES OF CIVIL PEACE AND WAR*%% The narrative provides glimpses of war throughout.The harrowing images of the war are reflected in this story.Achebe has skillfully woven the effects of war into Jonathan's story through Jonathan's characters and the events that take place around him.It is analogous to the devastation of the economy and infrastructure of the nation.
%%When Jonathan sees his house standing in the midst of the debris, this becomes clear.Additionally, when he observes the homeless people living in coal mines and consuming expired food.In the story, readers can also assume that innocent people died during the war.It is demonstrated when Jonathan dies and burys his son in the cemetery.
%%God, Optimism, and Resilience Jonathan uses the refrain "Nothing puzzles God" to cope with his loss and regrets throughout the narrative.This suggests that Achebe is encouraging the religious teaching through his writing.
%%Despite every setback, Jonathan maintains his optimism.Even though he lost his son in the war, he avoids getting stuck there.Instead, he takes action and believes in God and his destiny.He doesn't seem to be mourning his losses; he seems grateful for what he has.
%%LEGACY OF COLONIALISM *%%In the story, Achebe has shown the terrible colonialism of Britain.Achebe shows how the suffering and cries of Africans were ignored by colonizers.
%%He illustrates it through the tragic robbery at Jonathan's House.Even though they screamed, no one stepped in to help, not even the police or soldiers.Instead, the thief makes fun of authority by joking that the war is over and that civil peace has returned.This mirrors the
%%inadequacy of colonizers.Additionally, this reflects apathy on the part of colonizers toward their subjects rather than offering assistance to those who were exploiting them.
%%Achebe sheds light on the Africa of the time in his book UNTRUSTWORTHY AUTHORITY, LAW, AND JUSTICE.He exposes readers to the reality of bad governance.Military officers who accept Jonathan's bribe serve as an illustration.The reader is shown how people had to survive on their own.
%%Also, when the robbery at Jonathan's house went unreported by the police and soldiers.Instead, they remained completely silent.This demonstrates their lack of concern for the subjects' issues.
%%Work Ethics and Struggle*%% Jonathan started a small taxi service after the war.He then opens a bar at his house using the money.In the story, the entire Iwegbu family is working.Father is operating a business on one hand.On the other hand, mother and children are offering assistance by selling fruits, baking cakes, and cleaning wine bottles.
%%The effects of the war on the economy are also discussed in this.Everyone was struggling to make ends meet.By illustrating the homeless living in coal mines and consuming stale food, Achebe sheds light on this.
%%LITERARY ANALYSIS*%% Chinua Achebe, a Nigerian novelist, poet, and critic, wrote "Civil Peace" in 1971.His most well-known work is "Things Fall Apart."He mostly wrote about the effects of war and Britain's devastating colonialism.He called Britain's alleged goal of civilizing the world exploitation.
%%The issue of Africa in the aftermath of the war has been brought to readers' attention by Achebe.He reflects the deplorable state of society and how the colonizers humiliated and abused their subjects.Ironically, he disagrees with the idea of civil peace in Africa.He shows how violence was still prevalent even in times of civil peace through the story.
%%Achebe also depicts the brutal images of the civil war and revolution in Biafra.He has demonstrated how war has harmed society's economy and infrastructure.When Jonathan visits his previous residence, the glimpses of building debris demonstrate this.Despite the fact that his house was not completely destroyed, it was surrounded by the debris of other buildings.
%%In a similar vein, Achebe demonstrates how the war resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians.When Jonathan buried his son in the cemetery during the war, it becomes clear.This depicts war's devastation and bloodshed.
%%Achebe wants to show how miserable people are by illustrating Jonathan's family's struggles.After the brutal conflict, everybody was presented to outrageous difficulties.A large portion of them became
%%destitute and searches for the food.This way, it can be said that the Nigerian people's lives have been turned upside down rather than improved as a result of a futile war.Food insecurity and homelessness are also brought to light.When Jonathan flees his home with his family and seeks refuge in a refugee camp to save them, Achebe makes this clear.Additionally, when he visits the old coal mine and sees his former coworkers starving and homeless.
%%Achebe also disagrees with the idea of civil peace.He has demonstrated how society was still impacted by violence even though civil peace was promoted.He also investigates Nigeria's apathetic attitude and poor governance by criticizing the civil peace.Jonathan initially induces a military officer to abandon his bicycle with a bribe.Second, the police and soldiers did not respond when armed burglars arrived at his house and neighbors' homes.It's possible for readers to conclude that Achebe is attempting to convey that civil peace has not fully returned.
%%In addition to the aforementioned points, he gives society hope that, despite every obstacle, they will eventually reach their goal.Jonathan's character exemplifies this, as he endured tragedy with optimism and struggled for survival.Following the war, Jonathan started his taxi business by charging six pounds for each ride.He invests his money in the business of opening a bar in his own home after accumulating sufficient funds.
%%Similarly, Jonathan strives for his future at all times and does not regret what he has lost.
%%He didn't waste time mourning even when he was robbed; rather, he kept his attention on the work at hand.Achebe may be conveying the message to readers here to strive for the future.He wishes for the traumatized members of his society to begin working toward a better future.
     
%%Summary*%%: The narrator introduces Jonathan Iwegbu, a man who believes he is extremely fortunate to have survived the recent Nigerian Civil War.He has survived with the majority of his family, including his wife, Maria Iwegbu, and three of the four children. He even managed to keep his old bicycle.He loves the way his neighbors now greet one another because of his luck: &"Have a Happy Survival!"
%%Even though he is aware that his family is more valuable than his bike, keeping it was also a "miracle."of itself.During the war, a rags-clad army officer tried to take over the bike, and he almost lost it.Jonathan speculated that the officer might be willing to accept a bribe in exchange for the bike because he detected a "certain lack of grip and firmness in his manner."Jonathan buried the bicycle in the same clearing where his son and other camp casualties were buried for safety after the army officer agreed.He finds it after the war, still in good condition.He ponders, "Nothing puzzles God," as he feels blessed by his luck.When pondering his fortunate circumstances, he frequently comes back to this sentiment.
%%He quickly amasses a "small fortune" by starting a taxi service with the bike,which helps pay for his trip back to Enugu, his hometown.He experiences yet another minor miracle there:His house has not changed.Despite its small size and hand-built construction from zinc, cardboard, and wood, it has survived relatively unscathed in a neighborhood where most of the larger buildings have been destroyed.
%%The majority of the wreckage has not been touched since the early return.He gathers the materials he needs to fix the house and then hires a subpar carpenter to do the work.
%%He quickly relocates his family, and they resume employment.Maria makes breakfast cakes for the neighbors while his children pick mangoes to sell to soldiers' wives.Jonathan himself opens a palm-wine bar for wealthy individuals and soldiers.He occasionally goes to the Coal Corporation, where he worked prior to the war, but there are no indications that it will reopen.
%%Jonathan receives 20 pounds from the government Treasury after waiting in line for days to hand over his rebel currency."Like Christmas for him and many others," according to this payment,is referred to as an ex-gratia award, or a gift-based award given without a legal obligation.Egg-rasher is the name given to it because few people know how to pronounce it.
%%After witnessing a robbery victim collapse in agony when he discovered his award had been stolen, Jonathan is very concerned about losing the money.Jonathan stuffs the bills in his fist and stuffs his hand in his pocket to protect his own gift. He keeps his eyes down to avoid running into anyone on his way home.He has trouble falling asleep that night and remains anxious throughout the remainder of the day.He finally falls asleep, but he wakes up to the sound of someone knocking on his door shortly after.It's already very late.He asks who thumps, and the man recognizes himself as
%%criminal with &quot;him [sic] people.&quot;Jonathan and the kids soon join Maria in screaming for help and calling the police and neighbors at the same time.They stop after a couple of seconds, to hear
%%just quiet.The thief chorus responds with even louder cries for assistance when the leader of the gang mockingly offers to assist.Jonathan realizes that the leader is accompanied by at least five other men.The thief leader asks in a mocking manner whether he should now call for soldiers after proving his point that no one will come to help the family.They are advised to ignore Jonathan.After that, the thief leader asks for one hundred pounds and insists that they will not harm the family.He wishes there would be "no Civil War again."no more than a "Civil Peace."Jonathan makes the offer to them, claiming to only have 20 pounds to his name.Some of the group insists that they search the house and that he must be lying.They are silenced by the leader, who accepts the 20 pounds.
%%Neighbors pay a visit the following morning to express their condolences.Jonathan is strapping a wine jug to his bike, Maria is making breakfast cakes, and his son is cleaning old wine bottles, all of whom are hard at work getting ready for the day.It appears as though nothing happened.Jonathan tells his neighbors that he didn't care about the egg-rasher money because he had lost much more during the war.He concludes, "Nothing puzzles God."
%%SYMBOLISM OF JONATHAN'S BICYCLE*%% To begin, the story makes use of this symbol, which Achebe uses tactfully.The bicycle represents life's revival and hope.Jonathan unearths his bicycle and is surprised to discover that it is in excellent condition.He also fixed up his bicycle, which was how he started his first taxi service business.He invests his money in the bar business using the profits from the bicycle business, stabilizing Jonathan's family.
%%Achebe is of the opinion that despite obstacles, one should remain strong.They can achieve their goal in this manner.This is how he wants to encourage his Nigerian society, which was completely destroyed by the civil war, to try.
%%Everything was damaged in this manner following the war;Everyone was supposed to start from the beginning of their lives.The same is true of the bicycle.After it was excavated and renovated, Jonathan began his business and a new life with his family.EGG RASHER On the other hand, the story may include the egg rasher as a symbol.The conflict and violence of the postwar era are represented by the egg rasher.In addition, Jonathan received twenty pounds for delivering the rebel funds.However, the tragedy and threat to his family are brought on by this rewarded money.Jonathan gave the thieves this rewarded money to get rid of them when they arrived at his house dancing with one hundred pounds.
%%Achebe demonstrates in this manner that post-war conflicts and violence persist.
%%Even though the war is over, the society it affected was so badly that its effects will last a long time.
%%Achebe has depicted the military man who demanded Jonathan's bicycle in his imagination.He describes him as a man with a suspicious face, worn-out canvas shoes, and "toes peeping out of one blue and one brown canvas shoes" uniform.Additionally, his ranks were arranged erratically.
%%On the other hand, he depicts Jonathan's rummaging for supplies for his damaged home's debris.The "old zinc," some wood, and "soggy sheets of cardboard lying around in the neighborhood" are among the items he gathers.
%%Similarly, he described Jonathan's family's morning following the robbery at their home.While their neighbors came to offer their support, they were all preoccupied with their work.The "five-gallon demijohn to his bicycle carrier" was being loaded by Jonathan.In addition, his wife was cooking "akara balls in a wide clay bowl of boiling oil" in front of an open fire while she was sweating profusely.The wine bottles were also being cleaned by his son.
%%LITERARY DEVICES ALLUSION*%% When Jonathan saw his former co-miner consuming stale food and the remnants of bournvita tins, he used the term "Bournvita tins" to depict the brutal colonialism of Britain over Africa.This shows how passive the colonizers were toward their subjects.
%%PERSONALIZATION*%% In the story "Happy survival!" Jonathan's survival is personified by Achebe as happiness.This conveys Jonathan's feelings following the war.Even though he has been through a lot, he seems happy.
%%The "zinc house of no regrets" characterizes Jonathan's house further in the narrative.This reveals Jonathan's inner self, who had no remorse for his past.
%%In a similar vein, the "heaviest knocking" characterizes the harsh and forceful knock of thieves.The violence and danger Jonathan would face are portrayed here.Similarly, Achebe personified the callousness of the thieves' group by using the phrase "horrible chorus" to convey his point.
%%METAPHORS AND SIMILES*%% The narrative may also make use of metaphors and similes.For instance, the thief who robbed the man prior to Jonathan was referred to as a "heartless ruffian."This has been used by Achebe to emphasize the thief's cruelness.Also, Achebe has utilized the analogy "maritime
swarm" to feature the quantity of individuals.
%%The "day of the windfall" also describes Jonathan's fortune.It depicts God's mercy toward Jonathan.He is rewarded in this manner for turning over rebels' cash.
%%Through metaphor, Achebe emphasizes Jonathan's feelings."It was like Christmas for him," he says.This conveys his happiness at receiving his reward.He also draws parallels between his joys and the joy and excitement of Christmas day.
%%IRONY The title itself is ironic because it goes against the story's idea of civil peace.Contrary to the title, Achebe emphasizes the violence and incompetence of authorities.
%%REFRAIN Achebe uses the refrain "Nothing puzzles God" throughout the narrative.He highlights the hope through this.Also, the Divine ways that a mortal can understand.The manner in which God has been kind to Jonathan.
%%Genre andThe TONE novel "Civil Peace" is set in the past.The story's overall tone is optimistic and hopeful.
%%Perspective%%
%%Achebe has utilized the third individual restricted perspective.Through Jonathan's thoughts and perspectives, readers can delve into the story.


%%WHAT IMPACT DOES THE TITLE "CIVIL PEACE" HAVE?*%%
%%The ironic use of the title "Civil Peace" in Chinua Achebe's short story is particularly intriguing.After the Nigerian Civil War has come to an end, the story follows Jonathan Iwegbu as he sorts through the shards of his life.The Nigerian Civil War, also referred to as the Biafran War, was a prolonged conflict that a portion of Nigeria attempted to start as its own nation by secession.Jonathan gathers what he can to rebuild his life after the war has left a lot of destruction behind.Ironically, the story's title refers to the state of affairs in the region even though the war has ended.In fact, when a gang of thieves robs Iwegbu and his family at night, they call it "civil peace."
%%“Awrighto.Now, let's talk about business.We won't do wrong.We don't want to cause trouble.The problem is solved.All of the katakata wey de for the interior and the finished warNo more Civil War.This time, there is Civil Peace.Is it not?*%%
%%As a result, Achebe uses the title in an ironic way to show how violent Nigeria still is after the war.
%%What do you mean when you say, "Nothing puzzles God?*%%"in the Civil War narrative?*%%
%%By repeating this statement four times, Jonathan Iwegbu tries to understand the complexities of life in "Civil Peace."Indeed, everything baffles him, but if God comprehends, one can continue to meaningfully give life and be thankful for what they have.The first three times he says this, he talks about miracles that help the family after the Civil War, like finding their bike, keeping their house, and getting the egg-rasher.This phrase also talks about the benefits, drawbacks, and worth of life.The simple vocabulary, when combined with the basic sentence structure of subject, verb, and direct object, suggests a straightforward attitude.The absence of adjectives and adverbs creates a lack of description, possibly referring to the speaker's effort to forget the Civil War, which further contributes to the statement's simplicity.
%%Finally, the straightforwardness of the statement emphasizes the struggle for survival of the main character's family following a life-altering event.

        %%Summary:*
        %%Two soldiers named Luc and Jean typically spend their Sunday afternoons away from the barracks in the countryside.Their day off has become more like a ritual.They bring breakfast every Sunday to the same spot in the woods, where they lie down to enjoy the food, wine, and sights of their home town.
%%Eventually, a little innocent ogling of a young villager who brings her cow to pasture every week at the same time becomes part of their ritual.The girl, on the other hand, talks to them on her way to the pasture one Sunday. When she comes back later, she gives them some cow's milk and tells them she will meet them the next Sunday.
%%Jean suggests that they bring something for her the following weekend.They decide that candy would be a good gift, but when the girl arrives, neither of them are brave enough to tell her that they have brought something.Finally, Jean, who always carries provisions, gives the girl the bonbons after Luc tells her about the treat.
%%As time goes on and these soldiers spend time at the barracks, the girl becomes a topic of conversation, and the three of them quickly become friends.The girl appears to pay equal attention to the two recruits as she begins to share their Sunday breakfast.
%%Then, in an unusual move, Luc applies for leave on Tuesday and again on Thursday.
%%On that day, he borrows money from Jean without providing an explanation for his actions.The money is lent by Jean.
%%When the girl with the cow shows up the following Sunday, she runs up to Luc right away and they share a passionate embrace.Jean is hurt because he is left out, and he is unable to comprehend why the girl has suddenly focused solely on Luc.For a considerable amount of time, Luc and the girl disappear into the woods as they tend to the cow.Jean can't believe it.When they get back, they kiss once more, and the girl says "Good evening" to Jean before leaving.
%%They make a brief stop on the bridge over the Seine on their way back to their barracks, but neither soldier talks about the incident.Jean suddenly falls into the torrent after leaning further than Luc thought he should toward the water.Luc has no options;He is in agony as he watches his good friend drown.
%%The conflict that exists between friendship and love envy:The incompatibility of friendship and romantic love is one of the main themes of Two Little Soldiers. Two soldiers who were friends loved the same woman, but that love eventually tore them apart.
%%Betrayal:In order to woo the milkmaid, one of the soldiers betrayed the other, which drove the other soldier over the edge and led to his suicide.
%%The conflict that exists between friendship and love is the primary topic that Maupassant addresses.The story's "moral" is, in its simplest form, that a person and his best friend cannot love each other.However, Maupassant's skillful handling of the story of these two soldiers gives that idea poignant overtones.
%%From the beginning, it is abundantly clear that the two new recruits have a special bond.The soldiers have found a much-needed comrade in each other, whose shared interests and similar background make military life bearable, in a system that traditionally offers little freedom and little dignity for individuals.The initial scenes demonstrate their genuine connection:They make it through the week so they can spend Sundays together.These men have a special friendship that the military hierarchy relies on to ensure that men will bravely fight to save their comrades in war, a type of male bonding that is common among soldiers.
%%The strength of their bond is tested when an additional emotion suddenly enters their lives.The young girl they befriend captivates them both.Despite the fact that neither appears to be aware of the other's love, they compete for her attention in a quiet manner.However, in order to win the girl over, one of them must "betray" their friendship;It is impossible to fall in love with the girl and continue to have a relationship with his fellow soldier as before the girl entered their lives.As a result, in order to win the girl over, Luc must use deception:He asks for leave without telling Jean why, and he uses his friend as leverage by borrowing money to advance his own cause.When Luc and the girl inform Jean of their special relationship, it is not surprising that he is hurt and perplexed.
%%The tragedy is made worse by the reader's inability to distinguish between Luc and Jean's initial actions and reactions toward the girl.It becomes clear that Jean and Luc share the same feelings regarding the girl.Perhaps he has not pursued the girl himself because of his friendship with Luc;Perhaps his shyness has prevented him from expressing his feelings in public.In any case, he feels betrayed when he sees that Luc and the girl are in love, and his decision to kill himself is a logical outcome of his realization that he will not have a lover nor a friend.As a result, Luc and the girl pay a high price to experience happiness.
    
%%Technique, Style, and Setting The story takes place in the countryside of France, close to the town of Courbevoie.Although it is wartime, the scene is idyllic and peaceful;On Sundays, soldiers Luc and Jean, who live nearby in barracks, come here for a quiet meal and to enjoy the area, which brings them back to their home country.The young village girl who brings her cow out to pasture every Sunday when the boys are there adds to the beauty of the setting."A little innocent ogling" is what the boys begin to do.of the pretty girl, who eventually starts talking to them.
%%The effectiveness of "Two Little Soldiers" is heavily dependent on the setting and point of view.The pastoral setting in which the majority of the action occurs suggests tranquility and appears to indicate happiness.Maupassant is mindful so as not to uncover a lot of military enclosure life;The story is only interrupted by its regimentation, which contributes to the sense of release the two soldiers experience each weekend when they escape to the countryside.However, as the reader finds out when Jean is rejected by the two people who mean the most to him, the idyllic setting is not an escape from the harsh realities of the world.
%%Maupassant's use of point-of-view manipulation is perhaps the most important method for making his tragedy resonate with readers.The story of "Two Little Soldiers" can be seen as a series of dramatic scenes, even though the action seems to be going on all the time. The point of view changes as scenes change.Maupassant uses what seems to be the voice of an all-knowing narrator for a lot of the story.He gives equal attention to both soldiers as he describes their thoughts and actions to the reader.It is easy to overlook the fact that he says almost nothing about what the young girl feels or thinks during these first encounters because he appears to be providing straightforward information.
%%Then, at important points, Maupassant adopts a narrower perspective:He only tells the story from Jean's point of view when Luc makes the decision to take a leave of absence and when the two soldiers make their final trip to the countryside.The young man's confusion as his friend and the girl leave without him is all that the reader sees.The scene is seen through Luc's eyes as the two soldiers make their way back to the barracks:Because the reader is kept in the dark about Jean's feelings, there is no explanation for why he took his own life.
%%This method may result in poor writing charges;Certainly, Maupassant does not adhere to the school of realism's tenet that a story, novel, or poem should have a single point of view at all times.However, the aura that the author wanted to convey in this tragedy of the common man is directly attributable to his conscious decision to selectively switch between characters.
%%Examination (FOR Broadened Information)*
%%In Two Little Warriors by Fellow de Maupassant we have the topic of companionship, association, love,
change, discontent, struggle, selling out and desire.The story is told in the third person by an unidentified narrator, and after reading it, the reader realizes that Maupassant may be thinking about connection.Jean and Luc get along so well when they're together that sometimes nothing needs to be said.It has the impression that they are at ease sitting and walking in silence.However, they are aware of the other person's thoughts at the same time.Both friends appear to have a connection with one another through which they can read each other's minds.In fact, there is a bond between the two men that is unlike any other bond they share with anyone else.That is, until Luc falls in love with the dairymaid, which dramatically alters Jean's relationship with Luc.Maupassant may be demonstrating how a person's friendship can change when a third party gets involved, so this may be significant.Things that were once regarded as sacred are now not seen in the same light.
The fact that Luc leaves the barracks on two separate occasions shows how in love he may be with the dairymaid, leaving Jean to wonder where Luc might have gone.The reader also realizes at this point that Jean and Luc's friendship is in jeopardy.Jean is unable to comprehend the thoughts of his friend for the first time in the story.The fact that Luc and the dairymaid are so forthright about their love for one another is not helpful to Jean.Jean may even have the impression that Luc has discarded him.The reader is no longer left with the impression that Jean and Luc share an unbreakable bond.The simple fact that Jean has fallen in love with Luc has planted the seeds of Jean's discontent, which ultimately results in a disagreement between the two of them.At least, that's how Jean feels about Luc's relationship with the dairymaid. She has no idea how Luc could betray him.Despite the fact that their shared fondness for the countryside and the memories it evoked had brought the two men together.It strikes me as somewhat ironic that the dairymaid and the countryside end the friendship.
%%It could also be ironic that Maupassant chose two soldiers to be the story's protagonists.Typically, soldiers are associated with conflict and war, but not when they are on the same side as another soldier.Because Maupassant uses the countryside to not only connect Jean and Luc but also to convey a sense of peace and harmony to the reader, the story's setting may also be significant.However, this is not actually true.Jean is so shattered by Luc's betrayal that he jumps off the bridge.He seems to be unable to imagine living his life without Luc as his friend.
%%However, it may also be essential to keep in mind that Jean might have been in love with the dairymaid.If Jean is in fact envious of Luc's relationship with the dairymaid, he does take Luc's life.It's possible that Jean was so upset about missing out on two opportunities to be with the dairymaid and his friendship with Luc.
that Jean could only see the option of ending his life as the only option.
%%In point of fact, Jean may be in conflict not only in his mind but also in his heart.Jean takes the only course of action that he considers to be appropriate rather than accepting his circumstances and moving on, which would be difficult for anyone to do.Jean seems to have been defeated by his thoughts about his feelings for the dairymaid and his relationship with Luc.It might also be important to keep in mind that Luc also experiences feelings of conflict at the story's conclusion.His best friend committed suicide.
something that will have a profound impact on Luc's life.He will no longer enjoy Jean's company, and he has also broken up one of his strongest relationships with another person.It is difficult to determine whether Luc knows why Jean killed himself.Some critics may contend that Luc's secrecy regarding his encounter with the dairymaid was caused by his awareness that Jean might have liked the dairymaid as well.Even though it's possible that Luc was just too in love with the dairymaid to tell anyone, she might have just absorbed every thought of him, and as a result, the dairymaid took precedence over Luc's relationship with Jean.

        description: `
       %% The astrologer, the story's nameless protagonist, is actually a con artist rather than an astrologer.Every day, he sets up shop in a market under a tree, pretending to be a holy man with cosmic wisdom and wearing face paint.He listens to people's problems and offers what seems like wise advice for a small fee, dressing his common sense and manipulations in the language of an astrologist.
   %%Even though he does not actually know anything about astrology, he is very observant and helps his customers by answering questions that make them feel good about themselves and clear their minds.It is uncovered toward the finish of
    the story that the stargazer is secluded from everything, having escaped his home and previous existence as a rancher after he
    shakily endeavored to kill Master Nayak.He knows for sure that he killed Guru Nayak, but the thought of killing him makes him feel very guilty.However, rather than feeling sorry for Guru Nayak, his burden is motivated by his own self-interest.The astrologer makes no effort to atone for his actions, even when he meets Guru Nayak.The astrologer is the main character, but he is not the story's hero.The astrologer has a wife and a child, but neither of them is aware of his past of murder.
   %% Guru Nayak is the man the astrologer attempted to kill several years prior to the story's conclusion.Other than the fact that Guru Nayak has left his village and gone in search of the man who tried to kill him so that he can strangle him, very little is said about him.Guru Nayak is presented merely as a hostile newcomer who immediately expresses skepticism toward the astrologer and his alleged wisdom.Even though the astrologer is standing in front of him, he does not recognize his attacker because of the paint, turban, and long beard that he is wearing and the darkness of the evening.When the astrologer tells him the particulars of his attack and even Guru Nayak's own name, he eventually comes to believe that the astrologer is a prophet.He is frustrated when he is informed that his aggressor passed on under the
    tires of a vehicle a few months prior, yet fulfilled sufficient that he vows to get back and never
    dare to this town once more.Despite the fact that Guru Nayak is depicted as the story's antagonist, he could actually be viewed as the hero in the relationship between the two characters.Despite the fact that the story was written in English, Guru Nayak's name actually consists of two Hindi words:"Guru" refers to a spiritual guide or teacher, and "Nayak" refers to a hero.
   %% The astrologer's wife, whose identity is only revealed at the story's conclusion, is pleased that her husband has earned more money than usual from his work.She is also shocked to learn that her husband had tried to kill Guru Nayak before they got married and left his village.
   %% THEMES Mysticism and religious hypocrisy In his novel "An Astrologer's Day," Indian author R.K. Narayan tells the story of a dishonest astrologer who makes his living by selling villagers naive insights into the cosmos.Even though the astrologer has no real spiritual insight or knowledge of the cosmos, he takes advantage of his clients' search for meaning and comfort, burying his lies in the whims of religion and mystery.While Narayan's depiction of astrology and holy men does not denigrate religion, it certainly encourages it.The astrologer is presented as a normal man who, like any other human being, has problems with marriage, money, and tangled relationships. He is also full of greed and fear.He must borrow and fabricate cosmic insight because he lacks it.At the same time, the author is aware that such religious mysticism—real or imagined—offers a structure of meaning to ordinary people who face the same problems and, above all else, fear of insignificance and lack of control.
   %% The astrologer's attire and equipment are all designed to exude power and mysticism in his appearance.The astrologer lays out his "professional equipment," which is nothing more than a number of cowrie shells, a cloth chart that is too obscure to understand but looks sufficiently mystical, and a bundle of ancient writings and scrolls, in the opening lines of the story.He sells the illusion that he is a holy man with these props;He never puts the items to use.The astrologer has also wrapped himself in a saffron turban and painted sacred ash on his forehead—ironically, saffron is a Hindu symbol for purity and the search for light.
   %%The traditional image of holy men instructing their disciples under a grand tree, like Buddha attaining enlightenment or icons of Jesus Christ instructing his followers, is referenced by the astrologer as he sits himself beneath a large tamarind tree.He further reinforces the idea that he is a man connected to and in harmony with the world and the cosmos by associating himself with a magnificent piece of nature.However, the astrologer is fully aware that in such attire, "even a half-wit's eyes would sparkle" as his eyes, settled between the striking colors of his headgear and his black beard, take on a sharp, otherworldly quality that evokes powerful wisdom.In point of fact, the narrator makes the observation that "half the enchantment of the place had to do with the fact that it did not have the benefit of municipal lighting." This means that the marketplace itself only appears mystical because it does not have sufficient lighting that is provided by the government.These humorous details reject the astrologer's claim to be a true mystic and the outward manifestations of mysticism as meaningless and shallow.
   %% As a result, the astrologer's lack of cosmic wisdom is concealed by his keen insight and religious vocabulary.The astrologer admits to himself that he never set out to become an astrologer and that he does not know the stars or planets as well as their astrological implications as well as any other peasant.The unfortunate circumstances that forced him to flee his home years earlier after (allegedly) killing another villager, Guru Nayak, are only the cause of his position as a fraudulent holy man, which is a risky endeavor in a highly religious community.Despite this, the astrologer has improved his perception and developed a comprehensive understanding of human issues, which almost always revolve around marriage, money, or tangled relationships.He is able to give ambiguous advice and positive affirmations disguised as astrological language because he has this insight and is good at listening.He now knows what people want to hear, even if they don't know they want it.They are pleased to pay him his fee because they are reassured by what he has to say.
   %% Therefore, the astrologer's elaborate disguise is based on the fact that people are looking for meaning and are immediately inclined to give him credit.Strangely, the narrator believes that the astrologer is deserving of his wages and that his work is as honest as any man's.In point of fact, the astrologer serves as a kind of community therapist, though he isn't very good at it. However, he does encourage and reassure his patients during their difficulties.He fulfills his customers' desire for cosmic significance in some way;Their relationship is mutually beneficial.
   %% However, he frequently makes absurd connections between their everyday problems and his astrological explanations, such as when he links a temperamental problem to Saturn's position.
   %% The story's greatest hypocrisy is demonstrated by the fact that the astrologer uses his own disguise to evade punishment for a previous offense.The astrologer meets a skeptical stranger in the late hours of the night who he recognizes as Guru Nayak, the man he had tried to kill years earlier.The astrologer uses his guise as a religious man to convince the skeptic that his would-be murderer was killed months ago, putting an end to Guru Nayak's search for his assailant because he knows he will be killed if his identity is discovered.
   %% FATE Narayan's world is primarily Hindu, and fate plays a significant role.Every action that a person takes has repercussions, and nothing happens by chance.The astrologer's guilt at stabbing another young man in the village and then running away to avoid punishment forms the basis of the entire narrative.Later, it becomes clear that the stabbing was a foolish act of youth.
   %% Despite this, the astrologer lives with the fear of being found out, and it's odd that the victim is found out by him, not the other way around.He doesn't pay for what he did, but the story ends with him saying that he spent years regretting what he did, which is enough punishment on its own.
   %% The narrative requires a suspension of disbelief, and if credibility is strained at certain points, it is due to the author's conception of fate that defies rational explanation.The way Narayan depicts fate does not lead to complacency, nor does it rule out the significance of individual actions.
   %% However, there is a sense that human actions are part of a larger scheme.
      
   %% Summary: In an unnamed Indian village, an astrologer displays his tools, which include cowrie shells, obscure charts, a notebook, and other oddities.They only serve to create the appearance of mysticism.The celestial prophet has likewise painted his temple with hallowed debris, wrapped his head
    in a turban, and situated himself and his stuff underneath an enormous tree.Even though the narrator is quick to point out that none of these qualities actually belong to the man, all of these things serve to give him the appearance of wisdom, transcendence, and prophetic power.
   %% The astrologer has set up shop in the middle of a crowded market where people are auctioning off low-quality fabrics, selling stolen goods, and serving the same cheap food as gourmet treats.The astrologer, who was quickly exposed as a conman, is with other con artists and spin doctors who are making a living by selling their products.The astrologer's mystical quality is enhanced by the dancing shadows cast by a variety of shop lights and flares that illuminate the market.It is notable that he does not own a light and simply borrows one from other vendors.
   %% The astrologer had been forced to leave his ancestral home and travel several hundred miles away with no plan and no money despite having no intention of becoming one.Nonetheless, he is a convincing holy man who offers vague but comforting advice to market participants by utilizing his own insights into human issues.He acts like a therapist by giving self-affirming advice that he disguises as astrological advice.He is skilled in his field;He tells people what they want to hear, which makes them feel better when they leave.The astrologer earns a respectable living despite the fact that it is not honest.
    %%Guru Nayak, a stranger, appears just as the market is empty and the lights are turned off.Neither can see much of the other person's face in the darkness.The astrologer invites Guru Nayak to sit and have a conversation because he sees an opportunity for one more client.The stranger does so, but the astrologer is immediately met with suspicion.He bets a lot that the astrologer won't be able to tell him anything useful or true.The astrologer agrees with their price haggling.But when Guru Nayak lights a cheroot, the astrologer is terrified when he sees the man's face for a moment.Guru Nayak holds him to the wager and refuses to let him leave, despite his attempts to exit.
    %%Guru Nayak will not take the astrologer's usual tactic of vague, self-affirming advice.
    %%After a brief period of sincere prayer, the astrologer alters course.He tells Guru Nayak that he is aware that he was stabbed in the chest, left for dead, and that Guru Nayak is now here looking for his attacker.He even admits that he knows Guru Nayak's name, a sign of his cosmic insight.Guru Nayak is overjoyed by everything because he believes the astrologer to be truly all-knowing.In order to exact his vengeance, he asks the astrologer to locate the man who stabbed him.He is informed by the astrologer that he was crushed to death by an approaching truck several months ago.Guru Nayak is dissatisfied by this, but at least his attacker suffered a terrible death.
   %% He leaves after paying the astrologer.
   %% The astrologer arrives home late at night and shows his wife the money he has earned. He becomes irritated for a moment when he realizes that Guru Nayak has paid him a significant sum, but not quite as much as he promised.Despite this, his wife is overjoyed.The astrologer tells his wife as they fall asleep that a significant weight has been lifted off of him.Guru Nayak was forced to flee his home and begin a new life as a con artist after the astrologer stabbed him and left him for dead years ago.He had believed he had killed someone, but now he was content that he hadn't actually killed anyone.He then goes to sleep, content.
   %% A story's description helps readers imagine what happens.How does the author describe the astrologer?*%% What specifics and strategies are used?*%%
    %%The astrologer is a formidable individual.The narrator asserts that if he had remained in his village, he would have continued his ancestors' legacy of cultivating the land, living there, marrying, and maturing in his cornfield and ancestral home.
    %%But when he was forced to leave the village, he was able to use his intelligence to create a completely new persona and survive in an urban environment with a lot of people.According to the narrative, numerous rural dwellers may also possess a wide range of hidden talents if given the opportunity.The astrologer survives on his own two feet.Even though he is well aware that he does not possess any mystical knowledge, he is able to put on a show to entice onlookers and knows what to say to them.He probably does not know how to read or write.However, he possesses "street smarts," andquot;moxie.&quot;
   %% He had a rough understanding of the problems facing humanity:money, marriage, and the web of human ties
   %% His perception had been improved by prolonged practice.
   %% He only takes small bills for his consultations, probably because most people who go for walks in the park for fun don't have much extra money to spend.It is evident that he must sit for extended periods of time to accumulate sufficient funds to sustain himself and his family on a daily basis.
    ...his eyes sparkled with a sharp abnormal gleam that was actually the result of a constant search for customers. However, his simple customers perceived it as a prophetic light and felt reassured.
   %% In light of the precarious position he holds, money is very important to him.He is brave and determined in addition to his superior intelligence.The astrologer continues to insist on haggling over money even though he is interacting with Guru Nayak and his life is in imminent danger.In order to enable his wife to purchase food for the family, he brings every single coin home.He is clearly a devoted father and husband.
    "The Day of the Astrologer"is a study of one kind of adaptation and the turbulences of life.If the astrologer had stayed in his village, he would have been an ignorant peasant. However, the big city forced him to adjust to completely new circumstances, and he was able to find a niche where he could live, marry, and have children.He has survived.We can identify with him because we all must learn to adapt to our surroundings in order to survive in this world.
    %%Analyze "An Astrologer's Day's" conflicts.In the story "An Astrologer's Day," explain how the conflicts are resolved and what they reveal about the characters.by:R.K. Narayan is a novel-like short story with novel elements.Conflict is one of these elements.The problems that characters face throughout a story keep the plot moving are called conflict.Both internal and external conflicts, as well as the character's solution to them, are present throughout this narrative.The disagreements of "An Astrologer Day"allow us to delve deeply into the characters' lives and empathize with their struggles.
   %% The Astrologer, the story's protagonist, is involved in one of the first conflicts."He had a working analysis of the problems that humanity was facing:"money, marriage, and the tangle of human ties.Because he doesn't bring any money home, the astrologer is having marital issues.People don't go to his tent or study because they think he's a hoax.Additionally, he has issues with the nearby vendors.This is an illustration of outside struggle against society and its battles.When Guru Nayak gives him enough faith to pay for a reading, the astrologer finally has a chance to settle the dispute.The astrologer leaves with the money after the reading, and his wife is overjoyed and says, "I can buy some jaggery and coconut tomorrow...now I will prepare some nice stuff."The Astrologer's problem has been somewhat alleviated at this point.This demonstrates that he was waiting for an opportunity to amass a fortune because he was not an actual astrologer.This shows that the astrologer is smart, committed, hopeful, patient, and knows how to take advantage of opportunities.
   %% Guru Nayak, the other main character in this story, is involved in yet another conflict.When will I get my hands on him?*%%Nayak discusses the adversary who attempted to kill him.Nayak wants to exact vengeance on the person who attacked him and learn who did it.Although he may occasionally experience internal conflict when his emotions become overwhelming, this is an external conflict.When the astrologer states, "He died four months ago in a far-off town," this conflict is resolved.He will never again be seen by you.This demonstrates that Guru Nayak is not a clever person because he uses a roadside astrologer to locate his attacker rather than providing the police with a physical description.He is a believer in fate and superstition.
    
    %%Analysis (FOR EXTENDED KNOWLEDGE) Narayan vividly explains how the astrologer's appearance and tools give him a quasi-supernatural presence.Even though the author makes it clear that the astrologer is a con artist, it's easy to see how people could mistake him for more than just a man because of how convincingly he is described.Overselling their own value is a common practice among the vendors.The astrologer gives the impression of wisdom and power, while the food and cloth sellers give the impression of luxury.Each vendor exploits a desire for the luxuries of a more privileged life, catering to a poor population.Take note of the contrast between the Town Hall Park, which represents contemporary administration, and the astrologer, which represents ancient practice.
   %% There are two reasons why the astrologer prefers indirect, possibly subpar lighting.It helps conceal the fact that he is not a genuine astrologer while also enhancing his mysticism.Despite this, the author empathizes with him because of the way he acts as a therapist, listening to his clients' problems and offering advice that may temporarily calm them.Even though the astrologer fled after attempting murder, this foreshadowing is dismissive, reflecting his current emotions regarding the situation. Later, it will be revealed that the astrologer fled.He appears to attribute his departure to chance.Nevertheless, he abandoned the only honest life he could have had.Albeit the crystal gazer has no old insight, he doesn't appear to require it.
   %% Humanity's issues are the same as they have always been.It's possible that the clients of the astrologer only require a listening ear and a soothing voice to calm their nerves.The astrologer, on the other hand, knows that his clients want to appear to be in control and important, so he manipulates them to their mutual advantage.
   %% The astrologer has successfully maintained his ruse for another day as the light dims.However, under the cover of darkness, he may now be more courageous than he should be.Ironically, the greed of the astrologer is what brings him to an encounter that almost costs him his life and his false identity.Given that light has throughout the narrative represented the illusion of cosmic wisdom, it is significant that the stranger blocks out the light;The skepticism of the stranger is reflected in the blocking of the light.The stranger, in stark contrast to the other characters in the story, is immediately suspicious of the astrologer's credibility, and he is right.Again, the astrologer's greed gets the better of him, and he keeps trying to get more money.
   %% It is possible that the stranger—later revealed to be Guru Nayak, a man the astrologer thought he had killed—would have let him leave if the astrologer hadn't pushed the stakes so high. However, his self-interest has trapped him.He is now afraid for his own safety as well as the possibility of shedding his false identity, confronting his past, and feeling guilty.
  %%  The astrologer never even appears to consider taking responsibility for his crimes and being an honest man, despite being offered the chance to do so.He, on the other hand, uses his own experience to create a lie that is more convincing.Guru Nayak was close to forcing the astrologer to tell the truth and exposing him.Unfortunately, the astrologer misses his chance to live honestly.Worse still, he uses his previous relationship with Guru Nayak to permanently kill himself.The astrologer will never be able to match his accomplishments;He has executed his former self and satisfied Guru Nayak with dishonest justice.The astrologer's use of Guru Nayak's name suggests that they were fairly close friends.When the astrologer attempted to kill him, he was not a stranger, making the astrologer a fairly evil character.In addition to rejecting Guru Nayak's opportunity for confession, the astrologer issues what amounts to an astrological threat to abandon his search.The market has lost all light, and the astrologer's potential for virtue has also vanished.His wife's reaction to the money confirms that their family is extremely poor, despite earlier speculation.The astrologer is also rather petty for a holy man, blaming Guru Nayak for not having enough money rather than being grateful for his escape with his life.His wife is shocked when the astrologer tells her about a past wrongdoing, but he doesn't seem to know how serious it is.He goes to bed a completely liar and hypocrite man, content with the fact that he is not a true killer.He has ruined every opportunity for a genuine life.
