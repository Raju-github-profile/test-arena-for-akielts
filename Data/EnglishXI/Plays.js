        %%Summary:*%% Susan Glaspell wrote the 1916 play Trifles.The Wright family's home serves as the setting for this play.
        %%Three men and two women enter the Wrights' abandoned home at the beginning of the play.Everywhere you look, there is work that needs to be done.On the counter, dirty dishes and a loaf of bread are being set out.You can clearly tell when someone left quickly or was taken by accident.One of Mr. Wright's neighbors, Mr. Hale, the Sheriff, and the County Attorney are among the three men.Mrs. Peters, wife of the sheriff, and Mr. Hale's wife are also present.These people are here to find out what happened in Mr. Wright's murder.Since she was taken to prison, it is believed that Mrs. Wright was responsible for the murder.The men are there to look into the actual murder and determine who committed it, and the women are here with their husbands to gather a few items that Mrs. Wright might want or need.
        %%Mrs. Wright was pleating her apron in her rocking chair when Mr. Hale came by the previous morning to speak with Mr. Wright.He asked to speak with Mr. Wright because he thought this was strange and found out that he had passed away.Mrs. Wright explained that while they were sleeping, someone had killed him.She is said to be a heavy sleeper who didn't feel or hear her husband while he was being killed.Because it was their own rope that choked him, the Sheriff and County Attorney are aware that something is not right, and it simply is not conceivable that Mrs. Wright did not notice her husband being murdered.The women stay in the kitchen to talk and gather the items Mrs. Wright requested, while the men go upstairs to try to figure out what happened.In the end, they discover a dead bird in a broken cage that had been strangled like Mr. Wright.
        %%They were astonished, and they began to wonder if Mrs. Wright had actually killed her husband.They believe that she wanted to kill him because he had choked her in their home and prevented her from having a happy life.
        %%She was being smothered in the same way that she smothered the bird and caused it to die, and she lived in a cage like this bird.She therefore decided to kill him in order to end her spirit.The women had finished gathering the items Mrs. Wright had requested when the men finished their investigation upstairs.Mrs. Peters sneakily takes the dead bird and places the box in her pocket so that they won't find it as evidence, and the County Attorney made the decision to stay for a while to try to find out what had happened.She is aware that the men are seeking solid evidence to convince the judge that she committed the crime.At this point, all of the men are convinced that she killed her husband, but they are aware that she may be excused without solid evidence.The women are also aware of this, and they sympathize with the plight of the poor woman who lived such a dull and suffocating life for so long in this horrible house.They don't leave the dead bird as evidence because of this.
       %% Give your responses to these inquiries:*
    %%a. Do you think Mrs. Wright was the one who killed her husband?*Explain.
    
    %%Yes, Mrs. Wright killed her husband, according to my theory.After reading the play in its entirety, I believe her to be a murderer.Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters' thorough investigation into Mrs. Wright's misdeeds has revealed all of the evidence against her and established her as a murderer.

    %%c. Why is it that Mrs. Hale believes that Mrs. Wright's concerns regarding her preserves indicate that she is innocent?*

    %%2.Her first child, who was two years old, died.She had had a difficult time without her sweet baby.This
    %%experience associates her to Mrs. Wright&#39;s difficult stretch which she spent without her adorable canary.
    %%e. In what ways are men and women seen differently by women?*

        %%The Quintero Brothers' A Sunny Morning THE MEETING OF DON GONZALO AND DONA LAURA AT PARK:
        %%In Madrid, Spain, a tranquil area of a park is where this play begins on a serene autumn morning.At the very beginning, we see a 70-year-old attractive woman with white hair feeding pigeons bread crumbs from a park bench.Her appearance suggests a high level of sophistication.Petra, her maid, and she are both present.Petra later departs the location to meet the park guard.Don Gonzalo, an elderly man and his servant Juanito, enter as the next main character.At first, Don Gonzalo appears to be quite irritated due to the lack of a vacant bench in the park.Three priests are sitting on the bench he usually uses in the park.He approaches Laura's bench and shares her bench, reluctantly.Don Gonzalo irritates Laura to no end.She makes the claim that Don Gonzalo has frightened the pigeons that were feeding her breadcrumbs.She refers to him as "an ill-tempered man."Don Gonzalo dislikes sitting with the elderly lady on the bench.Don Gonzalo is the target of a continual barrage of insults from Laura.Don Gonzalo, on the other hand, gives up after using their impolite and pinching words of disagreement.He hands her his snuff box and takes it out.They both cough at the same time.They finally regain their friendly relationship with one another.

        %%Gonzalo got into a fight with that merchant one day.While Gonzalo was waiting to hear Laura's song through her window, the merchant made fun of Gonzalo.During that fight, Gonzalo injured the merchant.Fearing what might happen if he got into a fight with a merchant, Gonzalo fled his hometown for Seville and Madrid.In fact, that merchant was respected in that area.After that, he made numerous attempts to get in touch with Laura through letters, but none of them were successful.After that, he was unable to contact Laura.Laura's parents diverted all of his letters.Because of her parents, Laura did not receive any letters.

%%f. At the time of the conversation, where are the speakers?*

%%At the time of the conversation, the speakers are in a park.
%%g. When Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo learn in a flashback that they were once lovers, how does this knowledge affect the play?*

%%A dramatic device known as a flashback involves incorporating earlier occurrences into a narrative's normal chronological progression.This romantic comedy is very interesting because of the role that flashback plays in this play.When Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo learned that they had been lovers in the past, their flashback stories started telling us about different things that happened when they were dating.This play has been extended with a variety of hidden facts thanks to their flashback.The play features a fine climax and a variety of twists that reveal and conceal information due to its use.The two characters continue to utilize their flashback stories with different data which have made every one of the crowds focus and partake in each and every exchange of the play.This amusing play can be thought of as its foundation.
%%h. Discuss the play's emphasis on irony and humor.

%%This play is worked around humor and incongruity.The play achieves the perfect balance of irony and humor.The unique goal of this romantic comedy is to satirize and ironize all of its audience members.The witty dialogue of old Dona Laura opens this play.The play's sarcastic arguments between the two elderly people have resulted in an extremely amusing atmosphere since Don Gonzalo entered the park.We find irony in both characters' frequent pinching of one another.When they find out about each other, they start telling their flashback stories, which piques everyone's interest and makes them want to learn more about the characters.This play is full of humor and irony because of the way they interact with ironic comments, the lies they tell about their deaths, the ways they hide their identities to fool each other, and their promise to meet in the next sunny morning, among other things.
%%i. In what ways can the title "A Sunny Morning" be justified?*Discuss.

%%The title 'A Radiant Morning ' is reasonable.The set of this play is a park in Madrid, Spain, on a sunny morning.In this setting, the entire play has been shown.A lovely old-age meeting between two former lovers took place here on a sunny morning.They argue, know each other, keep their identities a secret, admire each other, tell fake stories about their deaths, and would rather meet again in the sunny morning, among other things.In this sunny morning setting, the entire play continues to make us laugh out loud from beginning to end.As a result, the film's title, "A Sunny Morning," is perfectly fitting because it depicts a lighthearted reuniting of ex-lovers in a park.
 %%RESPONSE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTEXT a. What do you anticipate will transpire during the subsequent meeting between Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo?*Discuss.

%%In the subsequent meeting, I anticipate that they will be much more enthusiastic.This time, they will also communicate their emotions through fictitious channels.They will endeavor to make each other happy.This time, Don Gonzalo will undoubtedly be more forthright.He will attempt to show her respect.They will demonstrate their shyness to the readers.They will undoubtedly have more fun as a result of their pretentious behavior.
%%b. Were Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo wise to conceal their identities?*What impact might their secrets have on upcoming meetings?*

%%Yes, Dona Laura and Don were wise to conceal their identities.They both came to the realization, at the age of seventy, that they had been lovers before they broke up because of bad luck.However, they avoided revealing their true identities admirably.They were both quite old and in poor physical condition.They were upset because of their old looks.The disclosure of their reality would be pointless at this age.They decided it was safer to conceal their identities and act unfamiliar.They picked the most ideal way to partake in their sweet young recollections through counterfeit means.If they continue to lie in this manner, their secrets may affect their meetings in the future.There is never a prolonged period of secrecy.Due to their advanced age, there is a significant risk of secrets being revealed.They won't attempt to meet again in the future if they accidentally reveal their truths.

    description: `
        %%Farce: What is it?*
        %%A farce is a comedy performed in the theater with the goal of entertaining the audience through highly exaggerated, extravagant, and thus improbable situations.Physical humor, the deliberate use of absurdity or nonsense, and broadly stylized performances are also characteristics of farce.It also frequently takes place in a single location, where all of the events take place.For stage and screen, farces have been written.
        %%The French word for "stuffing" is the origin of the term farce,referring to the improvisations that actors used in medieval religious plays.During the 15th and 16th centuries, later versions of this play were performed as amusing interludes.
        %%The play "Refund" is centered around the character sketch of Wasserkopf.
        %%He is depressed and has given up hope of finding work.He is so gullible that even when people tell him he doesn't know anything, he believes them.His frustration and rage grow as a result.
        %%Wasserkopf is about forty years old and unemployed.When he goes looking for work, every place he goes turns him away.At one point, the proprietor even tells him that the school has taught him nothing and that he should go get a refund of his fees.So, with this idea in mind, after 18 years, he goes back to his old school to ask for a refund of his tuition.However, the savvy teachers devise a strategy to deceive him.They organize a test to demonstrate his intelligence.They attempt to demonstrate that Wasserkopf's most incorrect response is correct.THEME The failed education system, which tends to prove itself right with clever logic rather than taking responsibility for its failure, is the play's primary theme.
        %%The summary is that Wasserkof has no manners and speaks abusively.He has no employment opportunities.Even if he gets a job, he won't be able to keep it for long.Everywhere he goes to apply for a job, people tell him he is useless and hasn't learned anything valuable in school.He once runs into Leaderer, a former classmate, on the street.Wasserkopf says he can't understand Leaderer when they talk about investing in foreign exchange and the Hungarian currency.He begins to inquire about currency exchange.Leaderer claims that he hasn't learned anything in school if he doesn't know about such a minor detail.He suggests that he return to his school and request a refund of his tuition.Wasserkopf, who is jobless and broke, thinks it's a good idea that will help him.So, after 18 years, he goes back to his old school and asks for his tuition money back, claiming that he hasn't learned anything useful from them.Hearing such an absurd demand shocks the principal.Wasserkopf even says that if he doesn't get justice, he will go to the education minister.He says he needs to get his money back if he fails the second test.The principal calls for an urgent meeting of all the masters after becoming quite perplexed and finding himself in an unusual circumstance.
        %%They agree to conduct the reexamination and agree to validate his correct or incorrect responses.They are aware that Wasserkopf would purposefully attempt to cheat on the exam in order to receive a refund from the school.As a result, each staff member makes the decision to outwit him and cooperate with one another.In an effort to be kicked out of the school, Wasserkopf addresses each master with abusive and derogatory language.The masters, on the other hand, outwit him by demonstrating his superiority in manners, physical culture, alertness, perseverance, logic, and ambition.
        %%The set of experiences ace asks him respectfully to sit on a seat however he goads the educator with his answer.The master begins his inquiry after maintaining his patience.He asks him for the first time how long the "Thirty Years War" lasted.The geography professor demonstrates his ten fingers three times while the teacher of physics loudly whispers the response.Waaserkopf claims that the war lasted seven meters, despite the fact that the answer is contained within the question.The teachers all become paralyzed.The mathematics master helps the history teacher when he can't prove that his wrong answer is correct.He argues that, in accordance with Einstein's theory of relativity, years can be measured in meters, and that the actual war lasted only seven years.due to the fact that the war lasted only one day (twelve hours), which equates to 15 years.The master subtracts three hours daily for combatants over the course of 15 years.eating, resulting in a 12 year reduction from 15 years.He subtracts yet more time for peaceful activities, non-wartime pastimes, and midday naps.He smirks as he finally turns seven years old.In light of Einstein's equivalence of seven meters, the candidate's response of seven meters is correct.The physics professor then inquires about the church clocks.steeples.He inquires about the optical illusion or the reason why the church clock shrinks when someone walks away from it.
        %%In response, Wasserkopf refers to the master as an ass.However, the master accepts the response as correct.The explanation is that because an ass is a sad creature, it lacks any creative abilities.Wasserkopf has responded with a metaphorical response to the master's claim that it must be an optical illusion.
        The geography instructor then asks him to identify the German province's capital, Brunswick.However, Wasserkopf responds with "same."By asserting that the city also goes by the name "Same," the master demonstrates that his response is correct.The emperor Barbarossa once met a peasant girl while riding through the city, according to a legend.After wishing her "God Bless You," he inquired after her about the city's name.The girl replied, "same to you, sir," while chomping on a bun.However, the emperor mistakenly called the city "Same."Masters mark Wasserkopf excellent in geography in this way.
        The mathematician finally advances to ask him his question.He declares that he will ask Wasserkopf two straightforward and two challenging questions.First, he asks him a straightforward question about the circumference of a polyhedron with 109 degrees of side with no relevant data for the calculation.
        Wasserkopf's response is incorrect.The mathematics instructor becomes enraged and states that his response is incorrect.As a result, he asserts that Wasserkopf is deserving of his tuition reimbursement.He then asks for the exact amount he needs.Without realizing the teachers' trap, Wasserkopf tells them the exact total of 5682 crowns and 38 hellers and the grand total of 6450 crowns and 50 hellers.The mathematician has concluded that his challenging response is correct at this point.His correct answers are supported by all of the teachers.They expel him from the school and give him high marks in all subjects.

        %%Because he believes he is worthless in life, Wasserkopf asks the school to reimburse him for his tuition.He repeatedly fails to find a suitable job for him.At forty, the only reason he views himself negatively is his education.He has no employment opportunities.Even if he gets a job, he won't be able to keep it for long.Everywhere he goes to apply for a job, people tell him he is unqualified and hasn't learned anything valuable in school.Leadrer, a former classmate, concurs with him and advises him to sue his former school for tuition fees.

Why did Wasserkopf offer absurd responses?*Why were these responses accepted by the teachers?*
        
        %%Because he wanted to cheat the exam and get his money back, Wasserkopf gave ridiculous answers.For the sake of their school's reputation, teachers accepted these answers because they wanted to pass him on the test.%%e. How does the Mathematics Professor characterize Wasserkopf?*
        
        The Mathematics Master describes Wasserkopf as a clever and sly individual who intends to deliberately fail his exam and recoup his tuition.He claims that Wasserkopf is an immature individual who lacks proper communication skills.He is very different, and his abusive language annoys all of the teachers.
       %% f. In what way did the educators deceive Wasserkopf?*
        
        %%By making good use of their minds, teachers were able to defeat Wasserkopf.Through his absurd responses, Wasserkopf attempted to fail the oral exam.However, the teachers supported his incorrect answers with various arguments.Wasserkopf was surprised to get his responses right.He was given a passing grade in every subject.His request for a refund was denied.Finally, he was kicked out of school.
        %%g. What is the final decision regarding Waserkopf's request for a refund?*
        %%The decision to deny Waserkopf's request for a refund is the final one.All of the teachers seem to benefit from the outcome.With the exception of one, all of the teachers declare Wasserkopf's answers correct.In every subject, the school's principal declares Wasserkopf distinction.He has received certification and congratulations for graduating.

        %%He acts immorally in front of the principal and other educators.He refers to the teachers as "loafers."He refers to teachers in infuriating ways, describing the History Master as a "numskull," the Physics Master as "a cannibal," and the Maths Teacher as "an old stick in the mud.%%"
        %%QUOTE BEYOND THE TEXT%% a. The play is a satire on the educational system of today.Do you believe that students are not adequately prepared for life through our educational system?*Discuss.
        
        %%Yes, I believe that students are not adequately prepared for life by our educational system.The current educational system is far removed from the idea of real-world application.It has nothing to do with living in a practical way.It has deprived people of creativity and rendered them impractical.In the present day, many educated individuals possess high certificate values but lack knowledge of anything.
        %%Even the ability to lead others is lacking in them.As a result, the current educational system is producing ineffective workers in various fields.
        %%b. Instead of encouraging creative thinking, our educational system emphasizes memorizing facts.Do you think that education imparts knowledge that may not be applicable to everyday life?*Who do you attribute this to?*
        
        %%Yes, I believe that the information acquired through education may not be applicable to everyday life.We find that education and the knowledge that goes along with it are very far from creative thinking in the context of the current education system.The educational system's courses are designed in such a way that they have no practical application in everyday life.These educational materials have nothing to do with actual life.People who struggle academically also seek an easy course that emphasizes memorizing rather than creative thinking.The majority of students are focusing too much on passing exams and earning certificates.In their eyes, creativity has no place in their lives.They only care about obtaining high grades through a variety of means.This is directly attributable to the current educational system, which has tainted the minds of thousands of people.
        %%c. The majority of students prefer knowledge over exam preparation.Do you believe that certificate will be beneficial to them in the future?*
        
        %%No, I don't believe that certificate will assist students in their careers in the future.The majority of students are currently on the wrong path.There is a set amount of time allotted for their examination preparation.Before their examination in two or three months, they are seen much more frequently.They are averse to the idea of knowledge and believe in taking shortcuts to pass exams.Their approach to passing the exam is not beneficial to their future.Since certificates never reveal true talent or knowledge, they will undoubtedly face a lack of authentic knowledge in the future.The majority of students today receive fake certificates as well.
