        description: `
%%Frank LePena discusses oral tradition's significance.He continues to talk to all of his readers throughout this essay about his experiences and ideas regarding oral tradition.He says that the term "oral tradition" refers to a type of human communication in which cultural materials, ideas, knowledge, and art are received, preserved, and passed down through the generations orally.To put it another way, oral tradition refers to the oral transmission of cultural and ethical knowledge from one generation to the next.Speech or song, folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verse, and other forms are used to convey this information.The values of the culture are maintained through oral tradition.Sharing tradition is not an easy task.The task of oral tradition transmission appears simple in writing and speech, but it is quite challenging in practice.In this setting, young people as well as elders play a crucial role in upholding the culture's values.Speakers (older adults) and listeners (young people or followers) play a crucial role.Young people need to pay attention to what their elders have to say about cultures, religions, traditions, and values and follow their advice.The young people learn about the customs and various concepts associated with cultures and values from the elders.Young people must assume responsibility for elderly people whose loved ones have passed away.In order to preserve their community's values and cultures, they must assume responsibility for passing down oral tradition from elders.This way, cultures and values are passed down through generations through oral tradition.By preserving their concepts of tradition and knowledge of community life, young people can keep elders alive.The idea that elders are immortal is passed down from generation to generation.
%%If we are aware of our culture, tradition will continue to advance in the right direction.Elders were able to achieve the ideal position in their lives thanks to their way of life and concepts about life, belief, religion, culture, and values, among other things.They continued to oral transmit their tradition for the benefit of humanity from generation to generation.They demonstrated the righteous ways to continue on.They shared tradition for the sake of the generations to come and their own lives.
%%An educational tool for comprehending this natural world is an oral tradition.It is the proper method for safeguarding the people's values and cultures.
%%The author claims that the transmission of oral tradition from generation to generation is hindered by a number of issues.The following are the issues:
%%1.Inability to fill the "niche" of elders:
%%Oral tradition must be passed down from generation to generation in order to preserve our culture.Young people must obey and listen to their elders in order to attain their ideal position (niche).However, it is very challenging to fill the vacancies left by elders.The religious obligations of the elders—religions, ceremonies, dance, etc.—give the impression that the young people have little interest in their culture.have to do with their culture.Young people today don't like to follow tradition and culture and listen to them.It has become difficult to fill the void left by seniors.In order to preserve culture and values, oral tradition transmission has become problematic as a result.
%%2.People's reactions to modern technology:
%%Every generation is confronted with cutting-edge technology that supplants outdated ideas and practices.Along with advancements in technology, the modern world and its inhabitants are undergoing significant transitions.This natural world is undergoing a number of transformations in the name of progress.New things take the place of traditional ones.Modern technology has been responsible for the alteration of the climate and the natural world.With modern technology, people appear to be very busy.They are no longer connected to one another because of modern technology and their isolation.Due to the absence of active listeners or followers, it is challenging to maintain traditional and cultural values orally in this setting.
%%3.Impacts of the modern educational system:
%%People's minds are diverted by the modern educational system and the way it is perceived.The process of conducting research and gathering data is how knowledge of the present is perceived.It's possible that the oral materials that researchers in the field of tradition collect are incorrect.Even oral tradition-related information is altered by printing.However, information passed down through oral tradition can be altered or even corrected.People are made to accept information from printed pages, which are full of mistakes and very hard to fix, as part of the educational process.The published information about cultures and values makes it hard to pass values down from one generation to the next through oral transmission.
%%4.Information's source and method of perception and dissemination:
%%Oral means are completely necessary for oral tradition.As a literary tradition, it does not have any writing records.Sometimes, the speakers' information is transmitted incorrectly.Sometimes, the listeners even misinterpret the information.The listeners may mistake the historical information of the elders for fantasy because of the generational gap.Validating oral tradition or traditional tales becomes extremely challenging in this circumstance.The speakers and the listeners need to be able to understand each other correctly.The people who are listening need to have faith in what they are hearing.Keeping faith in our ancestors and traditions must guide how information is perceived and communicated.
%%Questions*
%%a. Do your friends know about your cultural practices?*

%%Yes, my friends learn about my cultural practices.I tell them about the customs, ceremonies, and cultural events that my family follows.Even more frequently, I have invited my friends to my house for religious services.
%%b. When you were a child, did your parents tell you stories?*If so, did they have any bearing on your values or culture?*

%%When I was a kid, my parents did indeed tell me stories.My own values and culture were directly influenced by their religious tales.I gained a deeper understanding of my religion through their religious stories.
%%c. Should we keep our cultural customs and values?*Why?*

%%Indeed, we ought to protect our social qualities and customs.In order to maintain our cultural and traditional values in our lives, we ought to preserve them.Our lives can move forward with the right ideas and choices thanks to their preservation.Our cultural traditions and values always point us in the right direction in our lives.
%%Understanding the Text Provide responses to the following inquiries:
%%a. What is the significance of oral tradition, according to LaPena?*How much do you agree with his points of view, and why?*

%%LaPena asserts that the importance of the oral tradition lies in the transmission of our culture and values from one generation to the next through oral means.I wholeheartedly concur with his views because the values and culture of tradition ought to be passed down from generation to generation for the benefit of the people and their lives.In people's lives, cultural and traditional values are very important.
%%b. Who safeguards and transmits oral tradition?*

%%An art form known as an oral tradition is one in which cultural and moral teachings are handed down orally from one generation to the next.In order to preserve and pass on the oral tradition, young people as well as older people play a crucial role.First and foremost, elders are responsible for preserving and transmitting oral tradition.Young people are given this task next.This work goes from one generation to the next.The most crucial aspect is that oral tradition preservation and transmission must be the responsibility of both young people and elders.
%%c. What are the consequences of not passing on knowledge from one generation to the next?*

%%The culture and values of our tradition run the risk of disappearing if information is not passed down from generation to generation.Without their cultural and traditional values, people will have to live a meaningless life.
%%d. What distinguishes literary tradition from oral tradition?*

%%An art form known as an oral tradition is one in which cultural and moral teachings are handed down orally from one generation to the next.Through oral means, mistakes made in oral tradition can be changed and fixed at any time.Next, literary tradition includes both printed and written traditions in which information is conveyed verbally.Errors in this literary tradition are difficult to change and correct.
%%e. In what manner does LaPena connect art and oral tradition?*

%%Through his opinions, in which he presents the transmission of oral tradition from generation to generation, LaPena establishes a connection between art and the oral tradition.He asserts that oral tradition transmission is an art form in which both the speakers (the elders) and the listeners (the younger people or followers) play crucial roles.This art form effectively passes down values and culture from generation to generation.Oral speech, folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verse, and other forms of oral communication are all very artistic ways to convey tradition-related information.Oral custom is an exceptional workmanship through which the way of life and upsides of custom are safeguarded and kept up with in this world.
%%REFERENCE TO THE CONTEXT*
%% a. According to LaPena, oral tradition contributes to the preservation of a culture's values.Assuming you accept that the oral custom is significant, how might you keep up with it?*

%%I would follow oral tradition by engaging in the following actions:
%%1.I would do everything in my power to inform the people orally about culture and values.
%%2.I would make an effort to educate people about the significance of oral tradition.
%%3.Being responsible, I would impart information verbally.
%%4.I would form a group in my neighborhood to promote our oral tradition and culture's values.
%%5.I would educate my people about the advantages of oral tradition.
%%6.I would even ask members of my team to relay genuine information to everyone orally.
%%b. "Not everyone can fulfill the roles of the elders,"Using the essay as a reference, explain this statement.*

%%The elders' roles cannot be performed by everyone.Our culture is based on elders.Elders are the ones who first preserve and uphold our culture and values.Their roles in preserving our culture and traditional values are outstanding.Through oral tradition, they carry on preserving our culture and traditional values from generation to generation.They are able to achieve ideal life positions as a result of their vital roles.Their responsibilities to their cultural and traditional values are reflected in their religions, ceremonies, dance, and other forms of expression, all of which have an impact on a large number of members of the community.This void is extremely difficult to fill after the elders have passed away.
%%c. What is this essay's controlling concept or thesis?*

%%The central idea or thesis of this essay is that tradition should be passed down from one generation to the next through oral communication.The significance of sharing traditions has been made clear to all readers in this essay.Oral tradition transmission is an art form in which both older people and younger people play a crucial role in preserving tradition's culture and values.The task of sharing traditions faces a number of challenges.Young people and elders alike must take responsibility for their values and culture.They must have mutual trust and share accurate information.
%%d. How do the essay's topic sentences direct the reader's attention?*Without them, what would be lost?*

%%The topic sentences provide the reader with a variety of ideas regarding the significance of oral tradition sharing.The first sentences in each paragraph are referred to as the topic sentences.These topic sentences in this essay have provided information about tradition's culture, values, and methods for maintaining and preserving them.These subjects have supported oral tradition and the method of preserving tradition's culture and values.Through these topic sentences, we also discover a variety of issues with oral tradition.The essay will lack many things if these topics are not included:
%%1.sharing tradition is a valid idea.
%%2.controlling the essay's concept.
%%3.The significance of oral tradition.
%%4.responsibilities of youth and elders.
%%5.difficulties in keeping oral tradition alive.
%%6.solutions to keep oral tradition alive.
%%e. In terms of keeping the oral tradition alive, what are the four main issues that LaPena identified?*What role do they play in the essay's structure?*

%%LaPena identified the following four major issues related to the preservation of the oral tradition:
%%1.difficulty filling the void left by elders when it comes to passing on oral tradition.
%%2.the consequences of current technology.
%%3.The effects of the contemporary educational system.
%%4.Information's source and method of perception and dissemination
%%The essay's structure is constructed using each of these issues in a persuasive manner.Examples have been provided for each of these issues, as well as their respective solutions.These issues have been presented with oral tradition taking precedence.
%%%%REFERENCE OUTSIDE THE CONTEXT*
%% a. Describe your perspective on the oral tradition of information transmission in a paragraph or two.*
%%
%%%%Oral tradition, in my opinion, is one way that all people around the world can effectively preserve tradition's culture and values.I agree with the author that oral tradition is an art form in which both older people and younger people play important roles in preserving tradition's culture and values by passing on authentic information from generation to generation.For everyone, oral tradition is very important.We are able to preserve and uphold our cultural and traditional values through oral tradition.We can safeguard our cultural and traditional identity through oral tradition.
%%b. Our identity is our culture.Describe in a few paragraphs how you intend to preserve your cultural norms, values, and culture.*

%%I plan to protect my way of life, values and standards by doing the accompanying exercises:
%%1.celebrating each and every cultural ceremony.
%%2.educating people about the significance of our culture, norms, and values.
%%3.promoting traditional and cultural events in my neighborhood.
%%4.forming a cultural heritage-related organization.

%%When Steve was 17 years old, he enrolled at Reed College, an expensive college.He was paying for his college tuition with everything his parents had saved.He dropped out of Reed College and even those classes in which he was not interested after six months.He had no idea what would come next in his life.He was unable to find his life's purpose.He was unable to formulate a plan for his future.There was a question mark over the significance of attending college.He began enrolling in classes that interested him.He had to go through a lot in those days.To learn about typefaces, he enrolled in a calligraphy class.In those days, calligraphy was quite popular.He learned typefaces with and without serifs.As far as he might be concerned, the course of calligraphy ended up being a sort of shelter.After ten years, he used his skills and knowledge of calligraphy to design the first Macintosh computer.He created the stunning typography for the first Macintosh computer.He stumbled numerous times while pursuing his curiosity and intuition, but his difficulties later proved to be priceless.He realized that everything in his life was connected to dots.He realized, when he looked backwards, how various dots kept joining together to help him get to his real destination.His choices to drop out of college and pursue a career he enjoyed, as well as his experiences, difficulties, intuition, and faith in karma (destiny), among other factors.moved like various dots with his steps.He became successful when all of these disparate pieces came together in the end.

%%b. What exactly does he mean when he says, "You can't connect the dots looking forward;"You can only link them by looking back.

%%REFERENCE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTEXT a. One of Steve Jobs' guiding principles was,Think outside the box.Can this help someone achieve success in life?*What obstacles do you face when thinking differently?*

%%Yes, this can help someone achieve success in life.We must alter our thinking and behavior in order to alter a life.Our thoughts have got to change.We must attempt to change things.Similar thoughts will never be able to change a life in the right way.There are different difficulties in thinking in an unexpected way.Because they thought differently, many legends and inventors were treated poorly and cut off from society.They were meant to be crazy.People who think differently may be cut out of societies, majorities, and other groups.However, if we want development and change, we need to think differently.

        %%*SUMMARY:
        %%What I Require from Life by J. B. S. Haldane British-Indian scientist John Burdon Sanderson Haldane wrote this personal essay, "What I Require From Life."In the year 1940, this essay was first published in a newspaper called "The Daily Worker."Various political and philosophical perspectives on the needs of everyday life have been presented in this essay.It has primarily focused on socialistic convictions calling for workplace democratic activities.This essay has discussed the various needs of working-class people who are struggling to survive in a variety of settings.In this essay, the author has discussed his requirements and life experiences in very clear and straightforward language.His needs in life are similar to those of most people living in the world's working class.
%%The main summary of J. B. S. Haldane's "What I Require from Life" begins with the author's thoughts regarding his acceptance of the world as it is.He says that he shouldn't need the impossible things in his life.He asserts that he will do more harm than good to others if he tries to imagine perfect beings in a perfect world.
%%The author says that he was born in a peaceful time.He wanted to live a peaceful life when he was young, but when the devastating First World War broke out in 1914, he got involved in his heroic age.His idea of living peacefully changed as a result of the devastating First World War.He wanted to make the most of his time in that dire situation by meeting his basic needs for food, water, clothing, and a place to sleep.
%%The author of this essay has discussed four fundamental human needs that are extremely significant.The following are the four general requirements that the author and others require:
%%1.Work:
%%The writer needs work that pays well, which is very important for everyone.He considers himself fortunate to have chosen his desired work in large part.He claims that, in addition to his work in science, he can easily become a war correspondent, write stories for children, or give political speeches.
%%2.Freedom:
%%Next, the writer needs to be able to work freely.Freedom is so necessary for everyone.Freedom of speech is most important to the author.The law of libel prevents him from saying and writing about various poisonous aspects.
%%3.a healthy body:
%%Next, the author needs to be in good health in order to work.People can get everything they need when they are healthy.Joy and success in life are brought about by good health.
%%4.Friendship:
%%Next, the author needs his coworkers' and friends' friendship.In a society where criticism can be freely expressed, he favors equality.His friendship must be free of the idea of conformity and criticism.Friendship should be established with people of the same caliber.
%%The author also wants other things in his life in addition to these fundamental requirements.Even though there is risk involved in the adventure, he demands it in his life.He says that adventure satisfaction is much stronger than thrill satisfaction.He wants to have books, a car, a daily bath, a beach or a river in easy reach in his room.He wants all of these things but does not demand them.
%%The author considers himself fortunate to fulfill his essential needs, but his pleasures seem pointless if his friends do not satisfy these needs.He would like to see healthy people working everywhere.Depending on their capabilities, each worker must locate fruits.They should put in a lot of effort not only for their own profits but also for the well-being of their friends and family.
%%The writer wants workers to control how their work is done.He wants to see a situation in which workers play important roles and control the industry as a socialist.He wishes to see the end of sex and class subordination.To achieve fraternity, everyone needs to be treated equally.To end class and sex subjugation, there should be an economic revolution.

        DETAILED SUMMARY OF Vladimir Keillis-Borok's essay "Scientific Research is a Token of Humankind Survival" This essay was written by Russian mathematical geophysicist and seismologist Vladimir Keilis-Borok. It is titled "Scientific Research is a Token of Humankind Survival."The facts surrounding science and the remarkable impact it has had on people's lives around the world have been presented in this essay.This essay has demonstrated how scientists from all over the world transcend national identities to find solutions to global issues.The speaker of this paper is the essayist himself.In this section, we find him advocating science, claiming that science is the essential steward and protector of humanity.
%%The author begins by stating that scientists earn less than lawyers, doctors, businessmen, and other professionals.Despite this, some people continue to choose to be scientists because they can't live without it.The author asserts that science is an exciting adventure in which the discovery itself provides the primary reward.Through their discoveries, the scientist receives honors and promotions rather than large sums of money.While a scientist enjoys independence, camaraderie, and freedom, he or she earns less than lawyers, doctors, or businesspeople.
%%The writer then tells his readers about his experience during the cold war.According to the author, the President of the Russian Academy of Sciences summoned him to the capital city of Moscow in 1960 while he was conducting research on seismic waves—also known as Earth tremors.A letter from Geneva about a meeting in Geneva about nuclear weapons was shown to him by the President.Fran Press, a scientist from the United States, invited him to Geneva for the discussion.The writer found himself in Geneva as a result.
%%The fear of nuclear weapons' annihilation was so great at that time.People were constantly in danger.1960 marked the height of the cold war.There were a lot of nuclear weapons in the superpower nations like America, England, and Russia (Soviet Union).Using nuclear weapons, they could easily harm other nations in their first attack.Before Geneva Highest point, for the endurance of mankind, a significant choice was taken by the legislators of three strong countries.The new nuclear weapons test would not be allowed unless the three nuclear powers came to an agreement.Scientists from both sides had to come to an agreement during that incident to promote world peace and prevent the use of nuclear weapons. This was the climate of the cold war.The author learned from that episode that science is everyone's only hope for survival and well-being.
%%The agreement to halt the testing of new nuclear weapons was signed by the nuclear powers.However, they had to deal with the issue of how they (other powers) could detect a nuclear weapon test that was carried out underground and in violation of the agreement.As a result, scientists and other technical experts were brought in to resolve the issue.
%%The author had theoretical knowledge of seismic waves as a seismologist.His hypothetical information had an immediate application in the space of endurance of mankind.He knew a lot about earthquake tremors and earthquake tremors from underground nuclear explosions.The writer would easily be able to tell the difference between the two kinds of tremors given his knowledge.
%%The author asserts that scientists are the most practical people on earth.This can be seen in new technologies and industry brands, from entertainment to defense.Antibiotics, electronics, biotechnology, synthetic fibers, the green revolution, genetic forensic diagnosis, and other innovations are developed by the researchers.People always benefit from the fundamental knowledge of science in their lives.
%%The writer asserts that both natural and man-made catastrophes pose a threat to our civilization's continued existence.Earthquakes, self-inflicted destruction of megacities, environmental catastrophes, and social and economic crises are all examples of natural disasters.The author cites an outburst of mass violence and a massive release of radioactivity from nuclear waste disposal as examples of man-made disasters.
%%Because it is the only science that can guarantee our safe progression through time, science is our indispensable guardian and caretaker.
%%Countries had agreed to not secretly test nuclear weapons if humanity was to survive.However, human survival was ensured by science and its practitioners.It is the only science capable of distinguishing between natural earthquakes and tremors brought on by nuclear explosions.We can find new energy sources, mineral deposits, and effective defenses against terrorism thanks to science.
%%The significance of science's hope for humanity's survival is also greater.Both natural and man-made disasters are threatening humanity's safety right now.Whether the issue is terrorism or a tsunami, money alone cannot solve it.Only scientific solutions offer hope.As a result, the author has a myriad of reasons to believe that science is the only hope for survival.
