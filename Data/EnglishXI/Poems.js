%% WHAT THE BOY DID:
%%The next thing we see is the young boy peering out of a high window at the golden November sunset in the third, fourth, and fifth lines.The young boy can be seen here taking in the stunning golden sunset.The breathtaking view of the sunset seems to have captivated him quite a bit.
%%The boy's feelings toward nature's amazing transformation:
%%The boy clearly enjoys nature's beauty a lot in the final three lines.He has a very lovely way of feeling about the wonderful transition from day to night.When he sees how the beautiful November sunset transforms into the dark nighttime colors, he feels a strong connection to nature.This is nature's great miracle.
%%The speaker demonstrates a profound intimacy and reverence for nature in this passage.The speaker's closeness to the scenic beauty of nature brings back memories of his childhood, when he was a young boy enjoying a beautiful sunset at dusk.He keeps looking through a high window at the golden sunset.He is absolutely awestruck by the beautiful way that the day turns into the night.
%%A Few Things to Keep in Mind: Who Are You, Little I?*"The beauty of nature is beyond description," by E. E. Cummings
%%Nature can divert people's thoughts, feelings, and ideas, among other things.
%%The poet has thought back to when he was a kid and how he used to enjoy the beautiful outdoors at dusk.
%%The speaker is very pleased by the scene of the November sunset and its golden rays.
%%"We discover the speaker's profound yearning for this nature.
%%Provide responses to the following inquiries:
%%a. Have you ever taken pleasure in what you saw when you looked out of a window?*What did you look at, if so?*

%%Yes, I have enjoyed what I saw when I looked out of a window.During the monsoon, I observed a stunning rainbow in the sky.Finding such a clear and beautiful rainbow in the sky made me very happy.
%%b. Which stunning scenes do you believe would entice you to look out the window?*

%%I think I would want to look out the window because of the beautiful natural scenes like green hills, a rainbow that is beautiful and colorful in the sky, rain falling in the jungle, birds flying in the morning, and other things like that.
%%c. When you write, do you write the pronoun "I" capital or small?*

%%Yes, I always write "I" in capital letters when I write.We are taught by grammar rules that, when writing, this particular pronoun or letter must be written in capital letters.It is considered to be incorrect English grammar if it is written in small letters.
%%Understanding the Text Provide responses to the following inquiries:*
%%a. Who might be the poem's speaker?*

%%This poem's speaker might be the poet, E. E. Cummings.In this poem, he has portrayed himself as a young boy by recalling an encounter with nature as a child.
%%b. What exactly is "little i" up to?*

%%"Little i" is thinking about the beautiful way the day turns into the night as he looks out a high window at the golden November sunset.
%%c. What is the connection between "little i" and the poet's speaker?*

%%The relationship between the speaker of the poem and "little i" may resemble one of natural attachment.The speaker's recollection of events from his childhood led to the creation of the little boy, or "i."The speaker is praising this beautiful natural setting and reminiscing about his close relationship with nature as a child.The speaker demonstrates a profound love and respect for this vast and beautiful nature.
%%d. In the poem, what is the speaker recalling about his childhood?*

%%In the poem, the speaker is recalling a breathtaking natural scene from his childhood.He is reminiscing about when he was a young boy of five or six years old, peering out of a high window and taking in the November sunset's transformation.

%%In the poem, the speaker appears to have a loving and upbeat attitude toward the child.The speaker seems very nostalgic about his youth.He is overjoyed to be in the company of this lovely little 'i' of nature.He sees the golden sunset from the perspective of his childhood enjoyment.He seems to miss his early years a lot.
%%CONTEXT REFERENCE*%% a. Why do you believe Cummings placed a semicolon between the words "window" and "at"?*

%%I think Cummings has set a semicolon between the words window and at to break the two unique areas.He has distinguished the locations inside and outside the window by using a semicolon here.The young boy is sitting here inside the window, admiring the stunning November sunset outside.In relation to the boy's actions, the positioning of semicolons has resulted in the description of two distinct locations.
%%b. In the event that the speaker is the kid grown up, for what reason does he inquire, "who are you"?*

%%He asks, "Who are you?*" because it makes him happy to recall the carefree years of his childhood.He feels liberated from suffering and obligations.In order to convey the pleasures of his carefree childhood, which were closely associated with nature, he makes this request.
%%c. An adult examines her own childhood in this poem.That being the case, what could the lines be about?*and emotion:that, in the event that day must turn into night, this is a beautiful way)?*

%%The boy's feelings about the stunning November golden sunset can be seen in these lines.The boy discovers a beautiful method for transforming the daytime golden sun into the nighttime black sun.He feels about this wonderful natural transition.Therefore, it's possible that the theme of these lines is the beautiful changes in nature that transcend human thoughts, feelings, and ideas.Humans are profoundly affected by these changes.The deeper meaning of this theme also refers to the end of this life, which is full of obligations, burdens, and suffering.The daytime light symbolizes life, while the nighttime darkness symbolizes death.The lovely method of change of the day into the night additionally shows the idea of life and demise.The speaker desires to return to childhood and escape this life of misery.
%%d. In the poem, what is the rhyme scheme?*

%%The pattern of sounds that repeats at the end of a line or stanza is called a rhyme scheme.The poem employs the ABAB and CDCD rhyme scheme.
%%e. Describe the pun in "little i" that refers to his actions.

%%A pun is a joke that shows how a word could mean different things.Along with humor, it also refers to words that sound the same but have different meanings.The use of the pun is exquisite here, in the act of the "little i."The golden November sunset can be seen from the "little i."The boy, or "little i," has been shown here in a high window.In this instance, the rhyme scheme of "little i" and "high" is similar, but their similarities make the readers laugh until they figure out what they mean.The speaker has shown "little i" in front of a high window.Here, the misaligned height of "window" and "little i" has been displayed for the act of peering at the beautiful golden November sunset, which has sparked laughter.
%%f. In what ways does Cummings' use of lowercase letters influence how you interpret the poem?*Explain.

%%My comprehension of the poem is affected by Cummings' use of lowercase letters.His poem's use of lowercase letters has more literal meanings than just their forms.When writing English grammatical forms, it is considered incorrect to use lowercase letters.I have had a hard time understanding the poem's actual meaning because of his use of lowercase letters here.
%%REFERENCE BEYOND THE TEXT a. In what ways does the speaker of "who are you, little i" find inspiration in nature?*Explain.

%%In "Who Are You, Little I," the speaker is greatly influenced by nature.He has been reminded of his wonderful childhood by the natural beauty.In his childhood, he is a young boy of five or six years old.He keeps gazing at the stunning golden sunset and is moved by the beautiful way the day turns into night.

The day I saw a beautiful rainbow in the sky was the most interesting moment of my life.I was in fifth grade at the time.I was on vacation during the monsoon.After the rain on a Sunday, I was astonished to see the most stunning rainbow in the morning sky.I continued to watch it through my window for quite a while.I felt fortunate to have seen it.My life is still fresh with the beautiful rainbow scene.I want to experience it repeatedly in my life.

%%She discusses her beloved person's bravery and even the awards she still keeps in his memory in the second stanza.The medals with silver stars and yellow pips on the badge, which were his wartime gifts to his beloved character, still shine brightly as a testament to his bravery.However, since the brave person who received these awards is no longer with us, they are of no use.

%%She presents to him the barbaric image of war and its benefits to humans in the fourth stanza.She connects with him about the blood's smell and blood of his foe.She sees the dress of war as merely offering her blood in exchange for her being moved.She wants to present her idea that the war only invites negative outcomes for humans in this section.It just welcomes fear, torments, obliterations, blood, passings and so on.

%%This poem has shown how terrible war can be for people in this way.
%%       
%%PRIOR TO READING a. Have you ever experienced the death of a close friend or family member?*If so, how were you feeling?*

%%Yes, I have witnessed the death of a close friend or family member.When I learned that a close friend had died at the age of thirty in a terrible bus accident, I was shocked.
%%b. Does war always cause harm?*

%%Yes, war always causes harm.Humanity is always the target of war.It has absolutely no advantages.Disparity and a gloomy future for all are always on the horizon.It disintegrates everything.
%%Understanding the text Provide responses to the following inquiries:
%%a. Who is the speaker addressing, and why is she unable to hear or comprehend them?*

%%The speaker is addressing a person who is not presentâ€”a lovable individual.Because the person is no longer with us, they are unable to hear or comprehend what she is saying.
%%b. From the speaker's use of the term "you," what can you infer about how they feel about the person?*

%%I can deduce that the speaker has extremely strong feelings for the person referred to as "you."She considers him to be her life.She really misses him.She recalls that him each second in her life.Without him, she feels like her life is incomplete.The first stanza, in which she offers roses and her wedding dress for her beloved person's tomb, reveals her profound emotions.
%%c. How does the speaker feel about war?*

%%The speaker has a very negative view of war.She has been through the terrible war between Vietnam and the United States.Due to war, she has lost the person she loved the most.She has been living a miserable, lonely life without him.In her poem, she discusses various negative aspects of the war.
%%d. In what ways do you believe the speaker's circumstances have affected them?*

%%The speaker, in my opinion, has been influenced by this person's fate.In this poem, the absent person is a brave soldier who was awarded medals and a badge for his bravery during the war.He was killed by the explosion of the bomb during the Vietnam War.The speaker is experiencing his lack following his death.She is very miserable about her desolate life.She continues to recollect her adorable individual constantly.She is helpless, loveless, and miserable as a result of the person's bad luck.
%%e. At the poem's conclusion, what promises the speaker?*You believe the speaker does this for a reason.

%%The speaker makes a promise to meet her beloved person in their next life at the poem's conclusion.She needs to hold shrapnel as confirmation to show him the purpose for his demise and their division.She claims that it will assist them in recognizing one another.I believe the speaker does this because she has such a profound love for the absent person.She longs to love him once more.
%% REFERENCE TO THE CONTEXT a. What is the poem's underlying theme?*

%%The topic of the sonnet is the brutality and mercilessness of the conflict and its adverse consequences on people.War only steals the happiness of others and never brings happiness to anyone else.Disparity and a gloomy future for others are only facilitated by it.War has a profound effect on people.War only gives gifts like blood, death, pain, loss, sorrow, destruction, and downfall, among other things.
%%b. Which images from the poem stood out to you the most?*Why?*

%%The imagery is a literary device that uses images to represent things.In this poem, the speaker expresses her opposition to war through a variety of images.Images such as roses on a grave, a wedding dress as a cover, a tomb with green grass, medals, a badge, youth days, a wardress with blood, clouds, winters, lips that don't smile, arms that don't feel tender, eyes that don't see, the body that doesn't move, shrapnel as a token, and so on can be found here.Because the speaker refers to everything she has gotten from her beloved missing person in the sixth stanza, the imagery from that section left a lasting impression on me.Her lovable personality has vanished as a result of the negative effects of war, leaving her without lips that smile, arms that are tender, eyes that see, and a body that moves.This stanza has demonstrated how pitiful the speaker's life has become without her beloved person.
%%c. In the poem, which figurative language is used?*Give examples to explain.

%%Phrases that convey a message beyond the literal meaning of the words are referred to as figurative language.This poem's figurative language consists of irony, apostrophe, anaphora, metaphor, and other words.The poet frequently employs imagery and metaphors.
%%Ironically, this poem's title refers to war's gifts to humansâ€”pains, sorrows, losses, blood, etc.
%%The poet has also made use of the literary device known as the apostrophe, which refers to a sudden exclamatory piece of dialogue directed toward someone or something that is particularly absent.The speaker of this poem addresses an absentee and describes the barbaric image of war to him.
%%The repetition of the same words at the beginning of a line is known as anaphora.The poet has used the same words at the start of this line as he did in the second, fourth, and sixth stanzas for "You give me."In the sixth stanza, these phrases have been used three times.The poet has presented an irony in this passage about the gifts that the war and her beloved soldier have given her.
%%Last but not least, a metaphor is a figure of speech that compares two things that are not literary truths.Here in this sonnet, the artist has contrasted the mists and her eyes brimming with tears on mid year days and cold winters with her life's springtime.
%%d. In this poem, what does the speaker "offer"?*What does the individual addressing you as "you" offer in return?*

%%In this poem, the speaker offers her lovable person a variety of items.She offers roses, her wedding dress, youth, clouds, bitter winters, and other things.She receives the medals with shining stars, the badge with yellow pips, the scent of blood from her wardress, lips that do not smile, arms that do not feel tender, eyes that do not see, the body that does not move, etc. from the individual who addresses her as "you."
%%e. A literary device known as an apostrophe is used to address an absent person or abstract idea in such a way that it appears to be present and understandable.Think about the poem in terms of the apostrophe.

%%The inhuman depiction of war and its effects on humans are the subject of this poem, "The Gifts in Wartime."Here, the speaker has impeccably utilized punctuation where she is seen tending to a missing individual.She is using her persuasive lines for the deceased in this instance.She makes every effort to demonstrate to him how much she adores him.She keeps making the absent person aware of her gifts, sacrifices, lonely feelings, helplessness, the gifts of war as blood-stained army uniforms, painful feelings, death, and so on from the first to the last stanza.She connects with him about her forlorn life where she has encountered a great deal of torment without him.She has even revealed to him the primary cause of their separation and his death.The speaker and her dialogues for the absent person have been presented in this poem in a way that ensures that the reader will comprehend everything she says.Using the apostrophe, the speaker's dialogues for her absent, lovable person demonstrate the bitter reality of war against humans.
 %%REFERENCES BEYOND THE TEXT*%% a. Writing or speaking about one's grief is one way to cope with grief.How could the speaker of this poem have benefited, in your opinion, from saying what she did?*Explain.

%%The speaker in this poem has achieved success in conveying a serious message to all of her readers about the inhumanity of war.War always promises a grim future for everyone.On the battlefield, the sufferer is not the only one who suffers, but also all of the people who are close to him or her.In addition to the loss of her beloved person, the speaker of this poem has also been affected by the war.Here, the speaker's remark about her actions and sacrifices during her lonely life might have helped her share her experience of war with all of her readers.Through her hurt feelings, the readers have an idea of the negative effects of war and its long-term effects on humans.
