        %%*Summary:%% "The Children Who Wait" This essay was written by an American author named Marsha Traugot.This paper portrays the state of offspring of the US who don't have guardians.The essayist depicts parentless kids, their reception scene in the past as well as the purpose for the recent fad in reception in the present.
%%The situation that existed before the adoption of a child:
%%In the past, people only adopted white, healthy children when it came to child adoption.People didn't want to take care of children with disabilities or emotional issues.Until 1960, society was exceptionally severe about the idea of reception.White, healthy children were considered adoptable at that time.Children who were physically malformed were regarded as defective products.Adopting such children was out of the question.Black, mixed-racial, disabled, and older than five years old, none of the children were adopted.
%%Child adoption became a new trend after 1960:
%%People gradually developed positive attitudes toward child adoption after the 1960s.There were a number of factors that led to the shift in thinking.As responsible factors, Traugot has cited the black civil rights movement, the legalization of abortion, a shift in public sentiment, and a shift in government policy.A sympathetic attitude toward black people was brought about by the black civil rights movement.White people began to treat them as if they were human beings.The women's movement played a role as well.In addition to other rights, women gained the right to make all decisions regarding childbirth as a result of the women's movement.The woman who had to have an abortion in order to keep her status prior to movement could later live in dignity with her child.It helps to reduce the number of unwanted children.The adoption policy of the government was the third factor that contributed to the shift in perspective.In the past, the government placed an emphasis on foster care.The policy of the government was modified.They tried to find the homeless children a permanent home rather than focusing on foster care.The government launched a campaign specifically for homeless children with the assistance of the media.They tried to find better parents and a home for orphaned children, and they advertised homeless children in the media.In the past, children who were considered unadoptable are now widely accepted for adaptation.The author uses Tammy as an illustration, a black child who is five and a half years old and has fatal alcohol syndrome. She has been legally set free for adoption.
%%In America, specialists were stressed over the youngsters' future who stay in the halfway house for quite a while.They claimed that if they spent a long time in an orphanage, children might become violent or criminal.As a result, the government began making every effort to locate suitable parents for orphans.
%%Questions and answers from Marsha Traugot's The Children Who Wait*%% (Important) How were children who were disabled, black, or weak viewed in the past?*
%%Answer:
%%In the past, children who were disabled, black, or weak were viewed with bias.In the orphanages, their conditions were truly precarious.These children were not liked by anyone.They didn't want to adopt children like these who were weak, unfit, or black.These kids were supposed to be the bad guys.People who wanted to adopt orphaned children only cared about healthy white kids.The handicapped, black, and weak children received no attention at all.As a result, these children's circumstances were so awful in the past.
%%(Short 2057) - Whom does Marsha Traugot allude to as the kids who stand by?*
%%Answer:
%%The children in America who are living in orphanages and do not have parents are referred to by Marsha Traugot.She brings up both orphanages and orphanages alone.She describes the situation of orphans, the adoption of orphans in the past, and a new trend in adoption.These children, who have no parents and are homeless, always have their eyes on someone.
%%(Short 2060): Why were the black and disabled children unable to locate a foster home?*
%%Answer:
%%Due to the narrow perception of the people in the past, it was difficult for handicapped and black children to find foster homes.In the past, only white, healthy children were selected by those who needed children.Adoption of black and disabled children was frowned upon.Individuals had no profound touch towards impaired and dark youngsters.People only thought about healthy, white children.In the past, such acts posed a number of challenges when adopting unwell and black children.
%%(Short 2060) Traugot asks, "What changes are transforming the adoption scene in America?*"What factors are to blame for the change?*
%%Answer:
%%Traugot says that the American adoption scene has changed in the following ways:
%%The adoption of the child is without bias.Foster parents can choose any child, regardless of race or ethnicity.For instance, a black child named Tammy finds a foster parent.
%%Government officials and social workers make every effort to locate suitable parents for the orphans.
%%▪︎Kids get fine offices even in child care.
%%The following are the contributing factors to the shifts:
%%Social and conceptual sector advancement.
%%Abortion legalization.
%%Movement of the civil rights
%%Changing one's perspective on sexuality and behavior.
%%An anthropology study
%%(Short 2072 Partial): Why didn't children like Tammy adapt before?*The Children Who Wait) (Short 2075): Why are the children waiting for adoption like Tammy?*
%%Answer:
%%America's society was so rigid in the past.The majority of people lacked education and were narrow-minded.When it came to the adoption of a child, they demonstrated their skewed behavior.They didn't like the kids who were black because of their skin color.Children with disabilities were supposed to be broken goods.People didn't care about them emotionally.Adoption was only allowed for children of healthy white adults.The instance of Tammy was fairly something very similar.She had skin that was black.She experienced deadly alcoholic disorder.She was such a delicate infant.As a result, she was previously marked as unadoptable.
%%(Short 2062) – What kinds of parents were thought to be good candidates for adoption?*Which types of children were thought to be "Unadoptable"?*
%%Answer:
%%Parents were deemed suitable for adoption if they were educated, had the ability to handle the child well, and did not have any bias in the child's selection.Black children, those who were unhealthy, and those who were older than five were considered unadoptable.
%%(Short 2072): In what ways did the paper media support the adaptation process?*The Waiting Children) Response:
%%The author of this essay has discussed the significance of paper media to the adoption process.The experts on children say that children who spend more time in orphanages are more likely to engage in criminal activity and suffer from mental illness.Therefore, children shouldn't be kept in orphanages for a long time.Accordingly, the public authority of the USA took the assistance of paper media.Paper media continued to exert all efforts in promoting the orphans of one region to other regions.Children who had been in orphanages for a long time benefited from this procedure.People were able to get accurate information about the children from the media, and the children were able to easily find foster parents.People felt that it was simple to learn about orphans and adopt them through paper media.
%%(Short 2064): How are prospective parents discovered by adoption agencies?*
%%Answer:
%%The methods by which adoption agencies locate potential parents are as follows:
%%By distributing a newspaper article and a television advertisement about an orphan.
%%▪︎By preparing social specialists.
%%By providing regional exchange offices with specifics about the child.
%%By launching a variety of programs to educate the public about orphans.
%%(Short 2065): What had previously transpired with the handicapped children?*
%%Answer:
%%People were so narrow-minded in the past.They were not interested in adopting handicapped children.The plight of the numerous disabled children was so dire.They did not acquire foster parents for their upcoming lives.They were thought to be in bad condition.People were reluctant to adopt such children.

%%This essay's main point is that there are many good ways to help women during childbirth in traditional societies.Traditional methods of assisting pregnant women are not always superior to modern ones.
%%The author discusses the ways in which traditional and contemporary societies approach pregnancy, childbirth, and childbearing.
%%*Traditional East Asian Societies:
%%There are numerous superstitions, traditions, rituals, and customs in traditional society.All of these rights must be followed by a pregnant woman.She doesn't get legitimate regard at home and in the public eye except if she brings forth a youngster.Due to the traditions, customs and culture of the conventional society, the pregnant lady is cherished, minded and upheld by her better half, her relatives and every one of the family members.She doesn't worry much about the pain and danger of giving birth as a result.The woman is subject to prohibitions and taboos during her pregnancy.Therefore, actively performs all rites and dispels fear.The pregnant woman is surrounded by her family during childbirth.The risk of death for the unborn children is higher.In comparison to the West, the birth mortality rate is higher.The mother loses her own identity after childbirth.She is referred to as the child's mother, Ram's mother, Hari's mother, etc., rather than by her name.A child is born not only as a result of the parents' decision, but also as a result of broader family pressure.During childbearing the entire relatives are blissful.The mother will be welcomed with open arms.The woman can visit her mother in many societies.The entire family takes care of the children under the age of six.
%%The author uses children from Bangladesh as an illustration.Children under the age of six receive excellent care.They enjoy delicious food, games, entertainment, and other activities.They are free to play out in nature.Fairy tales are told to them.In the evening, they sleep with their mother.A child's birthday is widely celebrated.
%%*Society of the Modern West:
%%The woman is expected to take care of everything during pregnancy.She isn't minded well as in eastern culture.Even in the hospital, nurses and doctors make mistakes and are uncooperative.Assuming we discuss labor, we can find the pregnant lady encompassed by machines.There are some customs.In comparison to the east, the birth mortality rate is lower.A woman who is pregnant loses control over herself.A child should not be referred to by her mother's name.A child is born as a result of parental choice.Labor isn't being overseen very well in the west.There will be no one to welcome a woman when she becomes pregnant.People frequently lose a mother or child during pregnancy.The new baby is of little concern to the members of the family.They do not view childbirth as a significant event.
%%Germaine Greer's "Important ASKED QUESTIONS OF A Child is Born"* %%(Important): Why is the rate of infant and mother mortality higher in traditional societies?*
%%Answer:
%%The carelessness with which medicines are used contributes to the higher infant and maternal mortality rates in traditional societies.They are not receiving modern treatment or new medications.Traditional society's members have no doubts.The woman who is pregnant does not take very much care of herself.This woman does not receive treatment at the hospital.The infant may be born weak and in the wrong position in the womb as a result of carelessness.
%%How does a woman lose her identity in traditional society?* (Important)
%%Answer:
%%*In traditional society, a woman loses her identity in the following ways:
%%The girl is the daughter of someone when she is not married.Her husband's name is given to her as a result of her marriage, and she is Ram's daughter.Shayam's wife) When a child is born, she is referred to by the name of the child.Rahul's mother) As a result, she loses her identity and name.
%%(Short 2063): What kind of care is given to a woman in Bangladesh during her pregnancy and after she has children?*
%%Answer:
%%In the case of a Bangladeshi woman during her pregnancy, she spends the last few months of her pregnancy and the first three months of her baby's life at her parents' house.She is loved and cared for a lot by her family and parents.She is always in the care of her parents.The whole pregnancy thing is celebrated in some way.The entire family is filled with happiness when a child is born.The naming ceremony receives so much attention.New clothes are given to the mother and baby.Singing and feasting continue until late at night.Everyone dances and sings.The senior members of the family bless the mother and the child.After having a child, the woman is greeted with affection.(Short, partial 2066, Long 2071/2072) – In terms of childbearing, the author distinguishes between traditional and modern societies.
%%Or, could you outline the differences between traditional Western society and Eastern society in terms of childbearing?*
%%(Partially, long 2070) Discuss the perspectives of the West and the East regarding childbirth and child rearing.
%%Answer:
%%In traditional societies, the entire family is content when they have children.The mother receives warm reception.Every one of the family members including the spouses stay present during the method involved with childbearing.The mother feels less fear and pain as a result.She feels more at ease in their presence.Pregnant women frequently visit their mothers' homes in many eastern cultures.Under the care of the entire family, childbirth is celebrated.However, there won't be anyone to welcome and care for her in Western society.With the help of a doctor and a nurse, a pregnant woman must take care of herself.She is surrounded by doctors and cutting-edge medical equipment.The mother's emotional strength is reduced, but the child's health is protected.The child is only created to meet the needs of its parents.The death of a mother or child is accepted as normal in the place of birth.They are less concerned about the newborn child.Birth is not a significant event.During pregnancy and childbirth, the mother bears all of the burden.
%%(Long 2060, 2065) – In terms of pregnancy, childbirth, and childbearing, the author shows how traditional and modern societies differ from one another.
%%Answer:
%%(See the summary of the answer East and West) (Long 2067) The essay "A Child is Born" is frequently regarded as contentious and biased.Do you concur?*Be specific about why you agree or disagree.
%%Answer:
%%Yes, I concur with this assertion.We can see that this essay is related to the author's perspective if we read it.We are able to observe the author's monopoly in this type of essay.According to Conklin and Newport (2000), this essay is contentious;The majority of people disagree with some of Germaine Greer's ideas in this essay.For instance, she expresses that it is better for a lady to conceive an offspring customarily, and kick the bucket, than to utilize current prescriptions strategies and live.She also says that modernizing childbirth is bad because it will cause an explosion in particular.There is a real chance that this essay will encourage people to continue engaging in unsafe and unhealthy behaviors.
%%If we pay close attention to Germaine Greer's ideas, we can see that even the conventional method of pregnancy, childbirth, and childbearing has many drawbacks.She talks about a lot of things that hurt pregnant women.Greer claims that the female has lost her identity;Traditional society has a higher mortality rate.There is no cutting edge treatment for a pregnant lady.True blind faith exists.The pregnant woman takes little care of herself and other things.
%%      
%%Important: How does the customary behavior make pregnant women forget about their worries?*
%%Answer:
%%A pregnant woman is not burdened mentally in conventional society.She receives a lot of care and support from her relatives, which is the reason for it.She also receives assistance from her community.She gets mental relief to let go of her worries.During her pregnancy, she is required to adhere to certain guidelines.Every one of the family members including the spouses stay present during the method involved with childbearing.The mother feels less fear and pain as a result.She feels more at ease in their presence.The pregnant woman develops a sense of security as a result of all of these things.
%%(Long 2059) Write about the advantages of having children in a traditional society for about 200 words.How does the practice of traditional childrearing benefit the child and young mother?*
%%Answer:
%%Women in traditional societies are praised for their bravery and respected after childbirth.She receives gifts from a lot of people who come to see the child and wish the mother well.The birth ceremony is celebrated with parties.There is devouring, singing and moving.For a few months, the mother is allowed to visit her mother.Her entire family supports her in raising the child.The entire family takes care of a child under the age of six.Children under the age of six sleep with their mothers.At night, fairy tales are told to them.The family members respond to his or her request.They take their child to parties and other places where they can have fun, like swimming, dancing, sports, etc.For the following reasons, traditional child rearing is beneficial to both the child and the young mother:
%%The child and mother's relationship grows well.
%%"Mother and child receive love, care, and respect."
%%The child has the opportunity to learn about his or her relatives, family values and norms, culture, and customs.
%%▪︎The closeness among youngster and family is created.
%%(Important) – Nepali Mother's Position Answer:
%%The role of the Nepali mother in Nepalese society is so contentious.The process of childbearing determines the position of a Nepali mother.If a mother in Nepal has given birth to a child, especially a son, her place in the family and society is elevated to such heights.She is welcomed with open arms and respected by the entire family.In Nepali society, the daughter is less important than the son.Everyone despises a woman without children.She is compared to a land without fertility.She is viewed as an indication of a terrible star.In traditional Nepali society, a woman who has no children is considered to be a failure.In Nepalese society, being out of the way is a curse for women.Such a woman is referred to as the sinner by conservatives.They say that she was a terrible sinner in her previous life.They frequently neglect women without children.These women are also subjected to abuse by their families.If you want to be in a better position, especially for a Nepali mother, you should primarily have a son.After having a son, Nepalese society lavishes a mother with affection and care.Otherwise, the Nepali woman has a very hard time surviving in the strict Nepali society.
%%(Short 2073):When discussing the issues facing contemporary western society, why does the author use examples from the east?*A Child Is Born) The Response:
%%The author of this essay supports an eastern traditional society regarding pregnancy, childbearing, and childrearing.Despite her support for eastern traditional society, she has highlighted a number of its drawbacks.She is a writer from the West.She draws parallels between various aspects of traditional eastern society and these experiences.She has encountered a variety of issues in Western society as a woman.In Western society, a pregnant woman feels completely alone.She is not treated well by anyone present.However, women in traditional eastern society receive excellent care and treatment.The author brings the various positive aspects of eastern society regarding pregnancy, childbearing, and childrearing into focus in order to focus on all of the issues that women in western society face.
%%*(Significant) - Expound in on 100 words about the qualities held by the customary Nepali society in which a lady who can't bear youngsters is considered as a disappointment in her life and pointless according to society.Share your thoughts on the matter.
%%Answer:
%%Nepal is a male centric country.In this male-dominated society, it is believed that having children is necessary for generational growth.Therefore, celebrating a child's birth is an essential act.The woman who gives birth enjoys a high level of respect not only within the family but also within the community.Subsequent to having hitched, Nepalese ladies are supposed to have a kid.As per the Hindu religion, just fortunate and righteous ladies can get a child.Women who are unable to conceive are thought to be evil or witches.In traditional Nepali society, barren women are regarded as failures.In Nepalese society, being out of the way is a curse for women.The family does not treat these kinds of women well.
%%In fact, in traditional Nepali society, people believe in both a ghost and God blindly.The traditional Nepali population does not accept scientific explanations.Women who are unable to conceive are not given careful consideration; rather, their circumstances and future are blamed.
