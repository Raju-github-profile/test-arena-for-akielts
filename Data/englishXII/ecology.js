        %%*Summary:
        %%Two Issues in the Long Run:Moti Nissani's essay "Too Many People, Too Few Trees" discusses ecology and its transformation.In this essay, Nissani informs everyone of the harm caused by two primary issues.He says that the two long-term issues are:There aren't enough trees, and there aren't enough people.These two issues are connected to one another due to the certainty that forests will be cut down quickly to meet the demands of population growth when there are too many people.
%%The world is becoming more polluted on a daily basis, according to the scientists.Animals and plants of all kinds are disappearing as a result of air, water, and other substances becoming more poisonous.Overpopulation is the primary factor in environmental pollution.The author asserts that the global population grows by 80 million annually.He portrays Nepal in a realistic light.Nepal had a population of 9 million people in 1951.The number of people has increased to 23 million in less than 50 years.considering that the typical Nepalese woman has five children.Nepal has a high rate of population growth.According to Nissani, Nepal's population will reach 368 million in 140 years if this high birth rate continues.Nepal will soon have to deal with a number of devastating issues if this overpopulation isn't stopped.
%%While the rate of births declines, the death rate remains high.Overpopulation is causing chaos in the world's environment because of it.The majority of environmental pollution is caused by humans.Moti Nissani argues in this essay that trees should be protected for present and future generations.He suggests a few steps we can take to keep trees from being cut down and restore a healthy environment.He asserts that by controlling the population and educating them about the negative effects of deforestation, we can control deforestation.We can take care of this issue by utilizing smokeless ovens.The primary method for reducing the population that is too large is effective family planning.People should be discouraged from cutting down trees and encouraged to plant trees.Nissani concludes by stating that in order to live a healthier life, we need to be willing and motivated to reduce population and save plants.Our future will also be bright and secure if we do this.
%%The problems and effects of overpopulation are as follows:*
%%The lives of people will be severely impacted.
%%Their lives will be difficult and miserable.
%%People's demands for food, housing, and other necessities will rise, and they will have to cultivate more land by cutting down trees.
%%"The world will have too many people."
%%There will be no more trees in the world.
%%The source of water will dry up, and pollution will rise.
%%Village and town will become more crowded.
%%Overpopulation will also make it easier for various diseases to spread.
%%The measures taken to control the population are as follows:*
%%The effective method of family planning ought to be maintained worldwide.
%%People ought to be educated about the population.
%%People must be aware of the effects of overpopulation and the concept of birth control.
%%Our forest can be saved and deforestation stopped in the following ways:
%%To preserve forests, various activities should be regulated.
%%Keeping an eye on population growth.
%%supplying financial support for the forest's preservation.
%%The need to plant trees in areas that have been cleared of trees.
%%Cooking should not be done with wood products; fuel should be used instead.
%%In the context of Nepal, every house should have smokeless stoves.
%%When it comes to saving the forests, everyone should work together.

%%(2058 long):Explain the connection between deforestation and overpopulation.*
%%Answer:
%%Deforestation and overpopulation are inextricably linked.The greatest threat and challenge facing the people of the 21st century is overpopulation.People face a variety of issues as a result of deforestation, including flood, landslide, and soil erosion, among others.Overpopulation continues to be the primary factor behind deforestation.The human birth rate has increased significantly in recent years, while the death rate has decreased.Because of this, the world is bit by bit loaded with people.Worldwide pollution rises as a result of this overpopulation.Nowadays, people want more raw materials, land for their homes, and other necessities.People choose deforestation as a means of gratification.The effects of human activity on the environment include ozone layer depletion, flooding, landslides, soil erosion, and global warming.We look for food to satisfy our hunger whenever we feel hungry.In a similar way, when the number of inhabitants on the planet increments, individuals requests likewise increment.People deforest most of the areas in response to their demands, with a focus on forests.

        description: `
        %%*Summary:
        %%The song "Fathom Five Thy Father Lies" is from the play "The Tempest" by William Shakespeare.Ariel, the spirit, sings this song to Ferdinand, Prince of Naples, who erroneously believes his father has drowned.
        %%Ariel says that Ferdinand's dad is dead and is lying thirty feet underneath in the ocean bed.Ariel expresses her condolences to the Prince by stating that the Prince's father's passing is a significant change and that he will be greatly missed.He claims that his father's bones have transformed into coral and his eyes into pearls.Every hour, sea-nymphs honor him by ringing the death bell.None of the components have been wasted, but rather have increased in value.Ariel makes it appear as though he is paying attention to the bell's ding dong.
        %%Death is depicted as a significant transition in this poem.Death is merely a process of transformation into another natural object, not an absolute end.The song's central concept is that after death, the man who is a part of nature changes into other natural objects.Ferdinand's father's body has been transformed into something stranger and more valuable.His eyes are now pearls and his bones are coral.By ringing the bell, nymphs in heaven warmly welcome him even after he dies.
        %%*Question and answer:
        %%*Write a one-paragraph summary.
%%Answer:
%%Ariel tells Ferdinand in this poem that his father's body is thirty feet below the water.The passing of his father has been significant.Corals have replaced all of the dead person's bones.Pearls have now been added to the eyes.His body has not vanished or decomposed entirely; rather, they have been transformed into something valuable.Consistently the ocean sprites ring the memorial service chime for his distinction in a ding-dong sound.
%%(Important):Is there a message about death in this poem?*
%%(Short 2075) :Is the poem about death in any way?*Explain.
%%Answer:
%%Yes, this poem has meaning for death.Indeed, passing makes them mean in the sonnet.Thirty feet below the surface of the water is the body of the deceased.It is believed that the decayed body has vanished, but this has not occurred.The deceased person's entire body has been transformed into something bizarre and valuable.The dead body has altered the entire sea and left the sea creatures with a new sense of happiness.To announce his passing, the sea nymphs ring his funeral bell every hour.
%%(Short 2071):How do life and art relate to one another?*
%%Answer:
%%The connection between art and life is so close.There is a connection between the two terms.Art is present in places where there is life.Indeed, there is life where there is art.Every step of human life imitates art.The progression of life itself is a workmanship through which the idea of life gets significance in its genuine sense.Art will always be there to nourish life.The expression of life's reality is art.Art is related to the many things that happen in life.Life and art both progress simultaneously.There is never any separation between the two.
%%(Short 2067) What is the poem's central idea?*
%%This poem's central idea is that death happens naturally.One day, everyone must leave this beautiful world.Since death is a necessary occurrence, grieving over the passing of closers should not cause too much stress.One day, everything that exists will either decompose into ashes or soil.After death, the human being that is a part of nature changes into another thing.
%%(Long 2069):In the poem "Full Fathom Five Thy Father Lies," how does Shakespeare emphasize the significance of death?*share your thoughts on the significance of death in your life.
%%Answer:
%%William Shakespeare is the author of this poem.In this poem, he demonstrates the significance of death.He made a connection between the king of Naples's body and something valuable from the sea.In this poem, the Naples king is said to have fallen 30 feet into the sea and drowned.Ferdinand, the king's son, is weeping in memory of his beloved father.The poet has created a character called Ariel (spirit) to advise Ferdinand.Ferdinand receives advice from Ariel in a manner that enables him to forget about his father's passing and comprehend the significance of death.According to Ariel, his father's decayed and missing body has been transformed into something valuable.Corals have replaced all of the dead person's bones.Pearls have now been added to the eyes.Sea nymphs used to ring his father's funeral bell to tell him about his death in memory of him.The poet wishes to illustrate the crucial aspect of death.Since death is a necessary occurrence, grieving over the passing of closers should not cause too much stress.One day, everything that exists will either decompose into ashes or soil.After death, the human that is a part of nature changes.
%%(Important):Write an essay about art and life*:
%%Answer:%%Art and Life Life is a beautiful and priceless gift that God has given to all living things.Life happens naturally, and we are not immortal.Life is fleeting and naturally comes to an end one day.Every day, life gets older.Life changes with the passage of time.Art is an excellent instrument for improving life.We learn every aspect of life from art.It raises the standard of living.It makes life so gorgeous.Art gives life meaning and happiness.Life is perfect when everything is artistic in equal measure.Art plays a role in every action a person takes in their life.So craftsmanship and life are interrelated with one another.Up until the end, art is a part of life.Life comes to an end when art does.Life is fleeting.Man has goals, visions, passions, insights (that can be transferred), and aspirations.In life, we experience emotions and feelings.Life continues, as do these experiences and ideas.Success comes from art.Life, like a barren land, becomes dull and boring without art.
%%Writing poems, novels, dramas, etc., painting and drawing a picture, composing music, and acting are all forms of the arts. Man has a natural tendency to give his passions, emotions, and sentiments an outlet.Man gets involved in these things.The most important thing that brings us happiness and makes our lives attractive is art.Art gives life meaning and beauty.Life appears meaningless and unattractive without art.Our minds are drawn to fine art.Art is one of the things that gives us the most profound experiences and is more valuable in our lives.We perceive harmony in the object and feel harmony within ourselves when we enjoy the arts.
%%We are extremely content with any and all activities associated with the creation of art.As a result, we look for rejection in art, architecture, music, dance, and other fields.We recognize the value of art.Thus, there is a strong connection between life and art.

        %%*Summary:%% In 1971, two American geographers, M. Lilla Bishop and C. Barry Bishop, wrote the essay "Hurried Trip to Avoid a Bad Star."Both authors had traveled from Jumla to Nepalgunj on foot during their 15 adventurous months working on their research-based projects in the Karnali region of Nepal.Their foot journey from Jumla to Nepalgunj and the way of life of hilly Karnali people have been discussed in this essay.
%%They met numerous Karnali people on their journey.On the way, they talked to them and learned a lot about how they live their lives.They were aware of the economic ties that Nepalgunj and Karnali have.They also understood why people from Karnali rushed to Nepalgunj to avoid their bad star.To sell in Nepalgunj's market, Karnali residents carried baskets filled with hashish, blankets, hand-knit sweaters, silajit, and medicinal herbs.They were able to support themselves despite their weak condition thanks to that trade.They put in a lot of effort to produce silajit.While traveling, they prepared silajit.Individuals of Karnali sold things in Nepalgunj and got some cash.They brought cotton clothing, ironware, aluminumware, spices, jewelry, distillery equipment, and other necessities from that sum.
%%On their way, the geographers ran into a Chhetri woman.They learned from their conversation with that woman that her husband had left home 15 years earlier.She mentioned them to send him home, assuming they saw him.They heard the sound of trees being chopped as they walked down the slopes near Terai.They also discovered that most of the trees lacked leaves.They were concerned about Nepal's future.
%%They stayed the night there when they got to Nepalgunj.Bats, a mule, and a jackal made their sounds.Additionally, they observed Karnali people buying and selling essential items.
%%They finally left Jumla to finish their research project.They had a lot of new experiences and knowledge.They observed Karnali throughout each season and discovered that the inhabitants coexisted with nature.Additionally, they were aware that the land of Karnali would not supply them with enough food.As a result, they took jobs in Nepalgunj.
      
%%Hurried Trip to Avoid a Bad Star (Short 2057, 2061, 2063, and 2068): How economically connected is Karnali to the low-lying Terai/South/Nepalgunj region?*
%%Answer:
%%A remote area of Nepal known as Karnali is comprised of sloppy hills.As a result, there is no growth in any sector.The lives of Karnali residents are extremely difficult.They are unable to market their goods locally.As a result, people are forced to buy and sell their goods in the lowland region to the south.They must relocate to Nepalgunj in order to sell their products, which include blankets, hashish, hand-knit sweaters, medicinal herbs, and silajit.In a similar vein, they purchase clothing, kitchenware, and other essentials from Nepalgunj.They also look for work by moving to Nepalgunj, which is in the south.As a result, Karnali is economically connected to the low-lying region in the south.
%%(Short 2059): On their journey, what did the writers discover about the way of life and culture of the Karnali region?*
%%(Or 2066 in its brevity): Provide a succinct account of the Karnali community's daily life as depicted in "Hurried Trip to Avoid Bad Star."
%%(Partially answered in 2070): In the essay "Hurried Trip to Avoid a Bad Star," what kind of image of the Karnali region appears?*
%%Answer:
%%The authors learned a lot about the Karnali region during their trip.They were familiar with the Karnali culture and way of life.They say that the people of Karnali are innocent, hardworking, and ignorant.They are completely ignorant of the outside world.They rely entirely on either their own strength or the strength of the animals as they live in an extremely difficult region.They have no idea about deforestation and soil erosion.They also have a lot of superstitions.To avoid their bad star, they make a difficult journey to Nepalgunj.They coexist with the natural world.Their territories don't create adequate food things to help them.A lot of people do it to make a living.They bring blankets, silajit, hand-knit sweaters, medicinal herbs, hashish, and other items to Nepalgunj.They make a living by selling these items in Nepalgunj.They are not financially successful.The majority of people seek employment in Nepalgunj.They make every trade they can to avoid their bad star.Their life is satisfactory to them.
%%Important: What did the two authors learn about the way of life and culture of the Karnali region while walking?*
%%or What do the two American geographers' essay "Hurried Trip to Avoid a Bad Star" aims to demonstrate?*
%%or on the other hand Give a short record of the existence of individuals of Karnali.
%%Answer:
%%The two authors learned about the way of life and culture of the Karnali people while walking their journey.They attempt to demonstrate the extreme superstition of the Karnali people.The majority of Kamali's inhabitants are impoverished, illiterate, and illiterate.They put in a lot of effort to survive.Despite not even producing them, farming is the primary occupation there.The populace cannot solely rely on agriculture.They are short on food and other basic necessities.They must incorporate it into other activities.
%%In order to sell their home goods in the market, they are forced to travel far down to the Terai.They are conservative, traditional, and ignorant of modern life.They believe in God.While they try to avoid the bad star, they begin their work when there is a good star.They are backward and have a very low social and economic status.They are unaware of the connection between human existence and the natural world.Along with farming, they also do other jobs.Nepalgunj and their mountainous region have a strong economic connection.They lead a quiet life.They are primarily farmers.They travel to Nepalgunj with medicinal herbs, hashish, hand-knit sweaters, silajit, and blankets to sell, or they do so if their farm does not support them.In addition, when they return home, they bring cotton cloth, ironware, spice, jewelry, and other items.
%%Important: What goods were transported to Nepalgunj, and for what reason?*
%%Answer:
%%Medicinal herbs, hashish, hand-knit sweaters, silajit, blankets, and other items were being transported to Nepalgunj.In Nepalgunj, people from Karnali sold all of these goods.They were able to support themselves despite their weak condition thanks to that trade.They purchased cotton clothing, ironware, ironware, spices jewelry, distillery equipment, and other necessities for their survival from that sum.
%%(Important):Why and how did people from Karnali travel to Nepalgunj?*
%%Answer:
%%Carrying a basket filled with hand-knitted sweaters and blankets, medicinal herbs, hashish, silajit, and other items, Karnali residents traveled to Nepalgunj on foot.On the way, they processed silajit.To avoid their bad star, they traveled long and difficult to Nepalgunj.Individuals of Karnali sold things in Nepalgunj and got some cash.They brought cotton clothing, ironware, aluminumware, spice jewelry, distillery equipment, and other necessities from that sum.They made this hasty journey primarily to steer clear of their bad star.

%%The poet has trouble deciding which path is best.The poet enters a state of dilemma when she discovers the alive fawn inside the dead doe.He has no idea what to do and feels completely lost.He even makes connections between himself, the machine, and the natural environment.His emotional feelings for the little fawn inside his belly are evident, but his agitation is useless.He understands the worth of nature connecting with life and demise.He has no right to go beyond what nature tells him to do.It hurts him and everyone else.He experiences high levels of tension, but in the end, he selects the simplest option.The doe is pushed over Wilson River's road's edge by him.People feel in such a way however nature has its own guidelines and regulations.We only wait and watch and never act against nature.
%%(Short 2063): Do you concur with the narrator's actions?*Why?*
%%Answer:
%%Yes, I agree with the narrator because he had the right emotional connection to the fawn. However, when he realized he couldn't help the fawn, he pushed the doe into the river.He realized both how powerful nature is and how humans can't fight nature.He didn't want to defy the laws of nature.He came to the realization that man cannot alter the laws of nature.

%%Yes, I believe the author is concerned about the unborn child.The author moves closer to the dead doe in order to push it to the side. However, when he discovers the warm belly of the dead doe, he feels compelled to save the small fawn that is still alive inside the belly.The little fawn makes him so sad.He wants to save the life of the fawn.In nature, this tension causes a blockage.The author has a lot of feelings for the unborn child and also considers the child's bleak future.Other than his feelings, the author has no other choice.He doesn't want to challenge the power of nature.
