%%(Short 2058): Why was Will Sentry always following Mr. Franklyn?*
%%Answer:
%%Will Sentry is actually a very careful person.In the outing last year, he was tricked.The outing's collection from last year was taken.Therefore, Mr. Benjamin Franklyn will be the one to collect the total amount of money for the outing this year.Will Guard continues to follow Mr. Benjamin Franklyn to bring in certain that the current year's cash isn't taken.He doesn't want to miss the outing this year or the money.

        %%The Last Voyage of the Ghost Ship Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a Colombian novelist and short story writer, is the author of this short story, "The Last Voyage of the Ghost Ship."
%%This short story was first published in 1972, but it was later included in a book called "A Hammock Beneath the Mangoes" in 1991.The Stream of Consciousness method was used to write this tale.We can locate the main narrator's thoughts' continuous flow using this method.The main narrator's mental processes are very important here in this technique.Long sentences, especially unstructured soliloquies, are used in this method.We have difficulty comprehending the text as a result of this.In this text, there is only one full stop used.The entire text can be found in one paragraph.
%%This story has elements that are both real and supernatural.Fear, magical activities, and unbelievable events are examples of supernatural elements in this text.This text contains real events, real people's lives, and real objects for realistic elements.
%%*The Ship:
%%The boy finally proved the real ship.
%%It was 20 times taller than the church's steeple and 97 times longer than the village.
%%The world's largest ocean liner is whiter than the white.
%%Halcsillag was written with a curving style.
%%*Boy and the Village People:
%%The villagers, and even his mother, did not have faith in the boy.
%%â–ªï¸ŽThe principal explanation for distrusting the boy=Boy's depiction of the boat.
%%The boy used to refer to themâ€”the residents of his villageâ€”as skeptics.
%%The boy was also badly treated by the villagers.They beat the kid for making an unsettling influence.
%%The boy was the son of the same widow who had brought an evil chair into the village, according to the villagers.
%%"Now, they are going to see who I am," he used to say in rage to the villagers.
%%*Chair and Mother:
%%"A widow whose husband had passed away eleven years earlier."
%%She used to be so in love with her husband.
%%She never stopped thinking about her deceased husband.
%%She was so upset about the things her son was doing.
%%Her son used to sleep during the day and wander around like a criminal at night.
%%She had used the same old chair for 11 years.
%%She went to the town and won an auction for a new chair from Turk's store.
%%She died on that chair thinking a lot about her dead husband. The new chair was so comfortable, just like Sir Francis.
%%She suffered a heart attack and overthought her death.She died of sudden excitement, which caused her heart to fill with blood.
%%In addition, the chair swallowed four other women from that village. Seriousness = sudden excitement = heart attack.
%%The residents of that village believed that chair to be evil and threw it into the sea.
%%*Ship and Boy:
%%The boy saw the ship four times in his life.
%%His primary goal was to demonstrate to his village's skeptical inhabitants that the ghost ship existed.
%%He took a long time to prove that ship.He didn't acknowledge rout.He transformed from a typical young boy into a self-assured, assertive individual to demonstrate that ship.
%%First-time Boy's Experience:
%%On one of the March nights, he saw the ship.
%%-The ship as described by him:
%%The ship was so enormous.It also performed enchanted acts.It moved without sound or light.When it hit the rocks or crashed into them, there was no sound.It only showed up on a specific night in March.The fact that it vanished when the rotating light from the colonial city struck it was the most surprising aspect.
%%The boy referred to the ship as the "ghost ship" because of its enormous size and magical abilities.
%%"The boy couldn't believe his eyes when he first saw it."
%%It appeared to be heading in the wrong direction.
%%"The boy thought it was a dream."
%%He moved back to the shore at the same time the following day, but he couldn't find that ship.He just saw bungalows and precious stones runners stacking their boats.
%%Boy's Experience at Second Time:
%%On the subsequent March night, he saw the same ship once more.He told his mother about it, but she didn't believe him.His mom believed that his psyche was messed up.
%%Mother even sent a boatman to look at the ship, but all he found was a rabbit and hair.
%%The Boy's Third Experience:
%%He was left alone.His mother had passed away.She passed away prior to her son proving that ship.
%%When he saw it for the third time, he cried so loudly and frantically to wake everyone up.
%%He cried out loud, declaring that colossal whale had arrived.
%%The majority of the elderly were in such a state of panic when they heard the boy roaring at night, believing that William Dampier, their great grandfather, had returned.
%%The boy was severely beaten this time by the villagers for causing trouble.
%%"Now, they are going to see who I'm," the boy said in rage.
%%Fourth Time Having a Boy:
%%He took a small boat he had stolen and used his lantern to head in the same direction he had seen the enormous ship.
%%He waited there for the ship.
%%â–ªï¸ŽAt the point when he saw the boat, he felt no trepidation.
%%He pointed his flashlight at the ship.
%%The miracle occurred over the course of some time.The boy began to be followed by that enormous ship.
%%The boy led the ship to the church's sandy shore.
%%The ship got stuck on the sand because there was not much water near the shore.A loud whistle came from the ship.
"A lot of people went there."
%%Their mouths remained wide open as they observed the enormous ship.
%%The boy demonstrated himself in this manner in front of the entire village of doubters.
%%QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS TO "The Last Voyage of the Ghost Ship" (Long 2057): Tell the story of the boy's transformation into an assertive young man from a normal boy.
%%Answer:
%%The boy wanted to demonstrate his competence in front of the villagers by demonstrating that a ghost ship actually existed.He took a long time to demonstrate that ghost ship.To show it, the boy transformed into an assertive young man instead of the typical boy.
%%The ship was seen by the boy four times in his life.When he first saw that ship, he was taken aback.He went back there the following day to look for that ship, but he found no trace of it.He had seen a ship that was quite unbelievable.In the past, it would appear at night and vice versa.The ship was taller than the church's steeple and larger than the village.He saw the same ship by the harbor after many years.His eyes were unbelievable.He rushed home to tell his mother about it.His mother became enraged at him.She encouraged him to engage in a sentiment with some woman as opposed to going to the ocean.However, the boy's mother agreed to go there in March of next year.Sadly, though, his mother passed away while sitting in a chair and contemplating her deceased husband.When he tried to tell the villagers about the ship at night, he was beaten by them.The boy became more enraged as a result of that incident.His assurance became bolder;He headed in that direction with a lantern in order to show the villager that the ship was real.He never slowed down;He immediately set out for his destination.He saw the ship once more as he got close to the location.There was no sound as the ship moved.At first, the ship vanished in his presence.After some time, it came back.The boy turned on the lantern and pointed it at the ship.A miracle occurred when he demonstrated the light.He began to be followed by the ship.The ship was steered by the boy toward the village.He finally got the ship there.When the ship got there, it sped up.Ninety thousand champagne glasses had been destroyed when the villagers ran there.The boy observed the villagers wheezing at the ship.
%%(Short 2061): What does it mean when the boy sings, "Now they are going to see me who I am?*"
%%Answer:
The boy's remark, "Now they are going to see who I am," is intended to inform all of the villagers of the ghost ship's actual existence.When he was a young boy, the villagers made fun of him.He first saw a large, uncontrolled ship without light or sound when he was a young boy.In the light, it vanished, but it was there in the dark.The ship sank in the sea after colliding with the rock.He went to the water the following day, but there was no sign of the ship.
%%After a year, he saw the same ship once more.He told his mother about it, but she thought he was crazy.Before her son could demonstrate the ship, she passed away.
%%In a similar vein, the third time he saw the same ship, he summoned the locals to watch it.He was beaten by the villagers because they couldn't see the ship.The boy said he would accomplish his goal and show that he was a man.On March night, he saw the same uncontrolled ship.He showed it to the villagers as he led the ship to the village with his lantern.He had only a figment of his imagination when he had the vision of the ship, but later he used his adult passion to bring it to life.
%%(Short 2064): Why was the boy required to demonstrate his identity?*
%%Answer:
Because he was the only one who saw the ghost ship, the boy had to prove who he was.He wanted to demonstrate to the villagers that that ghost ship actually existed.The villagers consistently disagreed with him about the ghost ship.His words were not believed by the villagers, who instead beat him for causing trouble.The boy waited for years to see if the ghost ship was real.He went from being a typical kid to an assertive young man.He had to show that he was correct about the ghost ship in front of all the villagers%%.

%%(Short 2066): What is the ghost ship's most bizarre feature?*
%%Alternately, describe the ship.
%%Answer:
%%The ghost ship's ability to perform various magical tasks is the most bizarre feature.Only the boy can see it.It is observed on a specific night in March.Despite its size, it lacks sound and light.It travels through the town.When it hits the rocks, no one hears the sound.It vanishes when the light emission pivoting light from the pioneer city falls on it.
%%Being called "the largest ocean liner in this world," the ship seems magical.More white than anything else.It is multiple times taller than the steeple and nearly quite a bit longer than the town and the word 'HALALCSILLAG' is written in its body in a bended way.
%%(Short 2072 Partial): At the story's conclusion, how does the boy demonstrate his maturity?*
%%Answer:
%%The boy in this story is the son of a widow.He has seen the apparition transport ordinarily in his life.He relates everything to his mother about the apparition transport.However, his mother regards him as insane.He returns to the ghost ship after his mother's death and informs the villagers of its existence, but he is severely beaten in return by the villagers for causing trouble.His determination to demonstrate the existence of a ghost ship grows bolder.A year has passed.In one of the nights in March, he sees the ship once more.He leads the ship to the shore and takes it there.The villager population continues to gasp with wide eyes.At the end of the story, the boy demonstrates his maturity in this way.
%%(Short 2072): Why are the words "Now they are going to see who I am..." recited over and over again?*
%%Answer:
%%The narrative repeats this line.The boy, the story's main narrator, says, "Now they are going to see me who I am..."The boy uses this line as a sort of resolution to show the villagers who he is.He wants to demonstrate his knowledge of the ghost ship's existence.Nobody in the village has any faith in him.When he talks about the amazing ghost ship, his mother even thinks he's crazy.After his mother's death, he is severely beaten by the villagers whenever he tries to give factual information about the ghost ship.He gets very upset about the way the villagers act.He suffers for telling the truth.Through this line, he demonstrates his aggression.He wants everyone to believe what he says.His life is greatly enriched by the repetition of these words.He has transformed himself from a child into an assertive young man in order to prove himself or these words.
%%Important: Provide a description of the boy's daring work.
%%Answer:
%%At last, the kid sees the apparition transport once more.He decides to go to the ghost ship after gathering his courage.He moves close to the ghost ship after stealing a boat.He lights his lamp and guides the apparition transport up to the town's congregation.While the ship follows him, he does not feel any fear at all.In front of the entire village, he demonstrates his daring to succeed.
%%(Important): What was the boy's detestable reputation?*
%%Answer:
%%There were two reasons why people detested the boy.The boy was the widow's son, the villagers claimed, and he brought evil to the village in the form of a chair.Four women lost their lives because of that chair.After that, they detested the boy for causing trouble.The boy told them about the ghost ship, but the villagers didn't see it.The boy was beaten because he made up an imaginative tale about the ghost ship.
%%Important: What was the boy's mother's cause of death?*
%%Answer:
The boy's mother's death, in my opinion, was primarily caused by excessive thinking.After the demise of her significant other, she turned out to be so miserable and taken a break sitting on an old seat.She wanted to bring another seat from the town.She used to spend her time sitting on a new chair after bringing one home.She never stopped thinking about her deceased husband.While contemplating her dead spouse, unexpectedly she ended up being excessively energized and passed on that new seat.The boy's mother's death was thought to be caused solely by sudden excitement.

        description: `
        MAIN SUMMARY OF "GOD'S GRANDEUR" G. M. Hopkins is the author of this poem.Hopkins has primarily addressed the divinity of God in this poem.He has acknowledged God's immanence and praised God.
He has demonstrated God's presence in a piece of metal and oil flowing here.He asserts that God is omniscient, knowing everything, omnipotent, and omnipresent (present everywhere).
The author of the poem "God's Grandeur" has made an effort to educate readers about the power and divinity of God.He asserts that people in the world at the present time have lost faith in God.The world's population is so commercialized.People continue to destroy God's natural beauty without fear of God's punishment for the sake of their own better lives.Natural beauty is destroyed by modern humans using a variety of tools and machinery.Wastes everywhere have also diminished the soil's freshness.Because modern people wear shoes, their feet do not feel the refreshment of soil.
However, the poet is of the opinion that God's natural beauty cannot be altered in any way.God cares about the beauty of his creation because he is the world's protector.People, on the other hand, ruin all of nature, but the morning always brings some sort of refreshment to all living things.By the time the sun rises in the morning, everything is refreshed.God's only power is the one that wraps his warm arms around the world.
The primary theme of the poem is:
%%This poem's main theme is to make everyone aware of God's divinity.Today's people are so self-centered and focused on money.Even the creation (nature) of God has vanished from their memory.They disregard God's punishment and continue to destroy beautiful nature for their own gain.We must recognize God's strength and never attempt to break the rules and laws of God's creation because God is everywhere and in everything.
%%The following are significant inquiries and responses from God's Grandeur:
%%(Short 2071): What factors led to the god's power being determined?*Illustrate.
%%Answer:
God's divinity has created the entire universe.Everything that exists is the work of God.The most powerful being in the universe is God.God's divinity is so immense.God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-present.God is aware of everything.God is in every little thing.God is both the world's protector and the most powerful being.God's greatness and divinity transcend all.
%%(Regular, partial short 2070)2059, 2061, and 2062 (short versions) of God's Grandeur's central idea or concept
%%The immanence and greatness of God have been emphasized in this poem.People lose their ability to comprehend God's divinity.They criticize God's creation because they are too preoccupied with their commercial pursuits.However, God is the preserver of the natural world and its splendor.He is everywhere and wraps his warm breast around everything.The poet has advanced the idea that God is the cause of everything wonderful that happens on earth.The way humans use the earth is wrong.Always destructive are their actions.The earth has been seared, bled, and smeared as a result of them.The earth no longer has its original scent:Everywhere you look, you can smell people.Despite this, God never gets mad at his children.He keeps giving them the things they need.
%%(Short 2058) Can you explain why men are unaware of God's greatness?*
%%Answer:
%%The age of struggle for survival is the modern era.One must earn money in order to exist.When it comes to having a better life, money is a big factor.Nowadays, people only care about making money and are overly concerned with facilitated life.They spend their lives in a rat race (competitive struggle for wealth or power) in order to acquire all of life's amenities.They lose sight of God's majesty because they are too preoccupied with matters of the world.They do not support God's power or his greatness.They, on the other hand, value money and their own lives.
%%(Short 2067, 2071) In what ways does the poem praise God's glory?*
%%Answer:
%%By displaying God's greatness, this poem has praised God's glory.God is everywhere.He is in every smallest detail.God is the most powerful being on earth and knows everything.God gives this nature new life and energy.Because God cares about the well-being of all living things, all of his actions are directed toward their welfare.He continues to perform miracles without any expectation of financial gain.
%%(Important):Describe the poem's title.
%%Answer:
%%The poem's title gives us an idea of how great God is.God is beyond anything and so powerful.God is omniscient (knows everything), omnipotent (present in everything), and omnipresent (present in everything).God gives this nature new life and energy.God's grace governs everything on Earth.
%%(Important):Why are the men only interested in business endeavors?*
%%Answer:
%%The only reason men in this world are interested in commercial activities is to improve their lives.Men develop a focus on money in order to enjoy life to the fullest.They live their entire lives in the rat race, which is a competition for power or wealth.They are overly involved in world affairs.They view work as God and life as a struggle because their beliefs have become money.
%%(Significant) - How could God safeguard the magnificence of nature?*
%%Answer:
God has the power to preserve nature's beauty.God safeguards the entire world and its natural splendor.God is connected to all of nature's beauty.He is credited with the creation of all natural beauty and is regarded as its father.He is everywhere and wraps his warm breast around everything.
