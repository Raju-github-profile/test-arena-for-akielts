        %%*Summary: 
       %% Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart "The Tell-Tale Heart" is a short story by the American author Edgar Allan Poe.The first edition of this story was published in 1843.The narrator of this story dislikes being criticized for being irrational.He says he's not mad at all because he can do his work perfectly.He also asserts that he has a very keen sense of hearing because he easily hears things from heaven and hell.To legitimize himself as a holy person as well as a rational individual, he admits a risky wrongdoing that he had perpetrated.He claims that the elderly man and him once shared a home.They were very good friends.He used to be very fond of the elderly man.He was also treated very well by the elderly man.The elderly man's pale, vulture-like eye was the only thing that greatly irritated him.The only reason the narrator wanted to kill the elderly man was his irritation.He claims that the hot blood in his entire body turned cold when that one eye fell on him.In his room, he became restless and mumbled a lot of rage.To kill the elderly person, he went to the elderly person's space for seven constant evenings circumspectly and subtle.However, he returned unsuccessfully because the elderly man's eye was not open.He treated the elderly gentleman with respect in the morning and behaved as if nothing had occurred.He returned with his torchlight on the eighth night.He carried out everything carefully and covertly.Despite this, he accidentally touched a tin fastener, which fell and disturbed the elderly man's sleep.The elderly man asked who it was in a last-ditch effort.In one of the room's corners, the narrator remained silent and motionless.The old man was extremely anxious.He was aware that someone was in his room.The elderly man's heartbeat increased in rapidity.When he heard the old man's heartbeat, the narrator became more enraged.The narrator aimed the old man's eyes with his torchlight.He got angrier as he saw the old man's eye.He charged the elderly man.Fearful, the elderly man screamed.The narrator dragged the elderly man to the floor and used a heavy bed to press his neck.The elderly man ended up dying.The narrator dismembered the elderly man's body and hid the fragments beneath the wooden floor.He then disinfected the area.It was at that point four when he got done with his responsibility.Three police officers showed up later and rang the bell.They were greeted when the narrator opened the door.He took them to every recess in his house.There was nothing suspicious about the police officers.The narrator led them to the location where the old man's body had been hidden.He kindly requested that they take a seat on the chairs he had kept there.He sat right over the wooden board where he had stowed away the elderly person's body.With a grin on their faces, the policemen carried on talking.The narrator heard a sound coming from below in the interim.He imagined it as the elderly man's beating heart.He wanted to lower the volume of the sound.He started speaking loudly as a result.He heard the sound getting louder and saw the police officers chuckle.He couldn't keep the truth a secret any longer.He regarded it as preferable to confess to his crime to hide.He eventually admitted his crime.
   %%*Questions and answers:
   *%% (Short 2075): What does it mean that the phrase "low, dull, quick sound-much like a watch makes when enveloped in cotton" keeps coming up?*Is the narrator prompted to commit the crime by this sound?*
       %% Answer:
       %% This redundancy of the words ....." low, dull, fast sound-much such a sound as a watch makes when wrapped in cotton" has imperative importance behind the admission of the storyteller's large wrongdoing of homicide.This line shows the narrator's hostility toward the watch's sound, which he thought was the old man's heartbeat.Yes, the narrator is prompted to admit his crime by the watch's sound.At first, he finds it easy to converse with the police.However, when he hears a watch ticking beneath, he gets restless.His rage slowly gets worse.In an effort to quiet the watch, he raises his voice.It's like the old man's heartbeat to him.He hears a louder watch's sound and sees police officers with happy faces.Finally, he gets impatient and admits to killing the elderly man.
       %% (Long 2071) - For what reason does the storyteller kill the elderly person?*Would you describe the narrator as insane?*Give adequate justifications for your response.
      %%  Answer:
      %%  This narrative's narrator suffers from a nervous disorder.He has mental abnormalities.The narrator in this story has two roles.On one hand, he acts in a truly adorable way to the elderly person though he develops the serious contempt towards him then again.While he is distant from everyone else he becomes anxious.The old man's eye is the only factor in his animosity toward him.Every time he sees the elderly man's pale eye, he feels a lot of irritation.He refers to it as a vulture's eye.He claims that his body's hot blood turns cold whenever the elderly man looks at him.He kills the elderly man out of this ferocious hatred.
       %% Yes, for a variety of reasons, I would label the narrator insane.He kills an elderly man who was innocent for no big reason.Even after killing the elderly man, he shows no remorse for his actions.Both before and after he kills the elderly man, he kills without hesitation.He acts as though nothing has happened following his cruel act.His evil deeds demonstrate that he is insane.
       %% (Short 2073): The narrator's desire to kill the elderly man is why.Why does his seven-night attempt to kill him fail?*

       %%(Short 2066, 2068) Yes, I'd like to slam the narrator for being insane.He is afflicted with a mental illness.Because he always works well, he always says that he is not mad.He dislikes being called irate.Additionally, he asserts that he is overly sensitive and can discern between heaven, hell, and earth.He kills the elderly man for no significant reason.He shows no remorse or repentance for the murder he committed.He admits his guilt in front of the police to show that he is sane.I believe that sane people never do such things.

        %%*Summary:
        %% The play Purgatory by Irish author William Butler Yeats The religious play "Purgatory" was written by Yeats.There are four protagonists:Two of them are actual people, like the old man and his son, while the other two are the ghosts of the old man's parents.
%%At the beginning of the play, we see two characters standing in front of a completely destroyed house.One of them is the father, an elderly man, and the other is his young son.The elderly man talks about the house's history as he points to it.The particular house once belonged to his mother and her husband, according to the elderly man.The house and a lot of other property belonged to the wealthy mother of the elderly man.The old man's father later turned out to be a gambler and drinker.He sold everything his mother had owned due to his gambling and drinking habits.The elderly man's mother passed away while giving birth to him.His father carried on with his wrongdoings, eventually leading to the house's total destruction.He didn't send the elderly man to school because he was afraid that his son would outgrow him.The elderly man's mother's sole residence was destroyed by his father when he was sixteen years old.The boy became enraged as a result of the situation.Because of this, the father's son used a knife to kill him.After leaving the location, the boy became a peddler.
%%The old man informs his son that this is the night of his mother's wedding anniversary.A shadow that the man can only see appears as he finishes telling his son about the past.Later, the elderly man observes the ghost of his father dressed as a groom.The old man doesn't like the way they enter the room when they, the ghosts of his parents, move toward it.The elderly man's son regards his father as insane.The boy discusses the property following the incident.The young man should give the boy a fair share of the money.However, the elderly man denies sharing with him.The boy tries to take the old man's money bag as a result.There is a disagreement between them.They fight over the money, which is scattered all over the place.The young man is under threat from the boy.The old man's father's figure appears at the window in the interim.In rage, the elderly man cuts the boy to death while staring at him.The window light then goes out.In the white light, the bare tree appears "like a purified soul" and the stage has become darker.The elderly man at the tree weeps and explains his history of murder.He wants to stop the violence from spreading.He feels quite confident about breaking the cycle of violence after killing his son.
%%He finally examines the bloodied knife and cleans it.He then gets to work picking up the money that is all over the ground.He is saddened to think that the outcome has not ended when he hears the dead spirit's hoofbeats.He regrets killing his father and son without any apparent motive.This suggests that the mother is still enduring hell.Realizing that the dying woman's dream can't end, the elderly man is depressed.He prays fervently to God to save the suffering soul of his mother from hell.
%%*William Butler Yeats' "Questions and Answers of Purgatory" %%(Long 2071) asks, "Why did the old man kill his own son and father?*"Explain how religious belief is connected to this drama.
%%Answer:
%%To put an end to the violence, the elderly man killed both his own son and his father.He had killed his father many years earlier due to his father's various wrongdoings.His mother's entire wealth had been taken away by his father.Even the one and only house where his mother and he lived had been destroyed by his father.The old man's father's wrongdoings were the only reason his mother had passed away.The elderly man's father had not taken him to school.The elderly man killed his father when he was 16 years old for all of these reasons.When the old man's son turned 16 years old, he feared that the vicious cycle would continue.He was somewhat concerned about his son.He discovered in his son the same resentment he had once experienced in his father.He also killed his son to end that cycle of crime.
%%The elderly man in this play is worried about what will happen in the future.He has the impression that the agitated soul of his mother is still suffering in purgatory, which is the place between heaven and hell.He wants to let go of his mother's suffering soul.He kills his son to put an end to the violence and fulfill his desire.Religious ideals serve as the foundation for this drama.This play talks a lot about heaven, hell, purgatory, the soul, and other topics.
%%(Long 2069) Take any stance you want when interpreting the play "Purgatory.*"
%%Answer:
%%The play "Purgatory" by W.B. Yeats suggests that sin must be punished in order to grow and change.In this play, an elderly man who is haunted by his sin is the main character.Previously, his dad had obliterated his home and the life and property of his mom.He gambled, drank, and spent money on women.Therefore, when the old man was sixteen, he used a knife to kill his father.He then burned the body.He later worked as a peddler.In front of the burned-out house, the elderly man tells his son the entire story.The old man even sees a picture of his dead parents kissing on their wedding night there.Later, for money, the boy fights the old man.The old man kills the boy with the same knife he used to kill his father because he believes the boy is the result of his sin.However, by and by, he stills envisions that his mom is experiencing in limbo.
%%(Theme) The main idea of this play, according to William Butler Yeats, is that if a father commits a crime, his son will do it again, resulting in an endless cycle of violence.Wrongdoing continues to move from one age to another.
%%Important: What was the primary motive for the boy's death?*
%%(Or on the other hand) - What is the elderly person's thought process in killing the kid?*
%%Answer:
%%The elderly man becomes so afraid of the chain of violence that he kills the young boy.He believes that his son will commit the same crime as his father.In the future, he does not want his son to commit murder.He wants to put an end to the violence chain.He believes that people will continue to commit murder from generation to generation.
%%(Short 2072 Partial): Why was the boy punished by the elderly man?*Purgatory) Response:
%%The elderly man commits criminal acts in this play.The elderly man appears so cruel.When he was sixteen, he killed his father.He became a peddler following that crime.Numerous years passed.He happened to arrive at the same spot where he had killed someone.Just in front of his burned-out house, he told his son the story about his past.They got involved in the fight after that.The boy was punished by the old man because he saw signs of rebellion in him.He was so terrified of the chain of violence that would be repeated by his son when he thought about his revolt against his father.He feared this very idea and punished the boy.
%%*(Long 2063): Draw a portrait of an elderly man.
%%Answer:
%%The old man in this play is haunted by his sins.His father had previously destroyed his mother's home, life, and possessions.He gambled and drank and spent money on women.Thus, the elderly man had stabbed to death his father when he was sixteen.He then set his father's body on fire.He later worked as a peddler.
%%In front of the burned-out house, the elderly man tells his son the entire story.There the elderly person even sees the picture of his dead guardians, their lovemaking at the wedding night.Later, for money, the boy fights the old man.The elderly person feels that the kid is the result of his transgression and kills him with the very blade that he had used to kill his dad.As a result, in the end, he kills his son to end the violence.As per him, wrongdoing would happen from one age to another.He feels quite confident about breaking the cycle of violence after killing his son.He finally admits his mistakes, though.He prays fervently to God to save the suffering soul of his mother from hell.
%%*(Long 2064) - "We are always punished for our sins" Explain this statement more fully.
%%Answer:
%%This assertion is accurate.The facts of life are presented in this statement.Nobody can use their crime as an excuse.A crime will undoubtedly result in punishment.We are certain to be punished for any sin or crime we commit.I believe that it is completely incorrect for people to primarily talk about the consequences for sinners only after death.The reality of life and death differs slightly.No one is familiar with paradise and damnation as well as the later disciplines.These are merely the people's erroneous beliefs.However, the reality itself reveals the outcome.Like heaven and hell, there is no proper place for punishment.Throughout their lives, people are subjected to punishment here on Earth.There is no punishment at all after death.On Earth, people are punished for their sins or crimes.The best illustration can be taken from the old man's punishment.Throughout his lifetime, the elderly man is punished.He finally loses everything and feels bad about his actions.
%%*(Short Part 2066) Describe the manner in which "Purgatory" investigates the connection between human life and supernatural forces.
%%Answer:
%%The relationship between human life and supernatural forces is the subject of the play "Purgatory."The idea that a person's soul splits away from their body first appears in this play.The soul then reaches purgatory, which is located between heaven and hell.His or her soul is cleansed there in order to enter heaven.There is free, painless, and real life after passing through purgatory.The soul then ascends to heaven and acquires divine qualities.The spirit in limbo languishes and tried over new life.
   
%%*(Short 2070) Discuss the father-son relationship in the play "Purgatory."
%%Answer:
%%In this play, both the dad and the child have a feeble relationship.They are both so self-centered and avaricious.The boy's father has been guilty of numerous offenses throughout his life.At the age of 16, he killed his father and set fire to his house.We can see that the boy tries to kill his father because he is selfish in this play.He desires a share of his father's wealth.The boy attacks the father in rage when the father denies giving the boy money.The father finally kills his son to end the violence.
