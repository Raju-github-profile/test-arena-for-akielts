        Hansel and Gretel by Jacob and Wilhelm Grim This well-known fairy tale, "Hansel and Gretel," was written by German philologists and fairy tale collectors Jacob and Wilhelm Grim.Hansel and Gretel, a brother and sister due to their relationship, are the story's main characters.The difficulties these two kids faced in the jungle have been depicted in this fairy tale.
%%In this tale, the poor family of a woodcutter once lived in a small house near a jungle.That family had four members all together.The woodcutter was the household's sole breadwinner.He had two children with his second wife.His first wife had passed away a long time earlier.Hansel and Gretel were his children from his first wife.In this story, neither the father nor the stepmother of the children are named.
%%That village once experienced a food shortage.The woodcutter became extremely enraged and discussed the matter with his wife.His wife told him to leave both of his children in the jungle.The woodcutter's wife persuaded him to leave his children in the jungle, but he did not want to.Gretel was informed of Hansel's knowledge of their various plans.After hearing what her brother had to say, Gretel started to cry.She became quiet after Hansel comforted her.He went outside and put pebbles in his pockets.He returned and fell asleep.The next day, parents led their children into the jungle early in the morning.Hansel kept pausing himself to drop pebbles from his pocket as he walked.To make it simpler for him to locate the path leading back to his house, he dropped the pebbles.He told his father that a small cat was saying goodbye to him on the roof of his house when he was asked why he had stopped.
%%All the way, Hasel kept dropping the pebbles.The father started the fire for them when they got to the middle of the jungle and told them to wait until they got back.Gretel began to weep after they vanished.She was consoled by Hansel, and he instructed her to wait for the moon to rise in the sky.The stones Hansel had dropped along the way began to shine as the moon rose in the sky.The next morning, both kids got to their house early. They followed those shiny pebbles.While their stepmother became quite enraged, their father was ecstatic to see his children back at home.
%%The years flew by.They then had to deal with yet another famine.One night, Hansel once more heard about his parents' plans.Hansel desired to fill the pebbles, but his stepmother had locked the door from the outside.Saying that God would save them, Hansel consoled his sister.
%%The following morning, both children received half-and-half pieces of bread.Gretel's half piece of bread was also taken by Hansel.While he was pausing, he kept dropping bread crumbs.He responded that the little dove was saying goodbye to him from the roof of his house when his father asked him the same question as the first time.
%%The kids were taken to the jungle's densest area the second time.The parents once more stoked the flames for them and promised to keep their word.They waited for the moon, but the birds in the jungle had already consumed all of their bread crumbs, so they were unable to benefit from the moon's rays.For three days, they got lost in the vast jungle.They wandered a lot, but they couldn't get home.
%%They were sitting under a large tree on the third day when they heard the sweet, melodious song of a white bird.That bird was perched on a branch from one tree to the next as it flew just above the ground.That white bird was followed by them both.The children were led to the bread-and-sugar-constructed house by that bird.
%%Both of the hungry kids got so excited and started hurriedly and greedily eating the house.An elderly woman came out crying, "Who is nibbling my little house?*" a little while later.
%%When she asked them about it, both of them said that the wind was eating away at her small house.When they first saw that elderly woman, the two children became extremely anxious.However, that woman graciously welcomed them both to her home.She provided them with delicious food.She even made them nice beds to sleep in.It was a heaven-sent pleasure for both kids.That elderly woman's true intentions were a mystery to them.That elderly lady wasn't kind; she was a wicked witch who liked to eat the flesh of children.
%%She demonstrated her actual actions to the children the following day.She wanted to eat Hansel's meat, but Hansel's body was quite lean.In order to bulk up Hansel, she locked him up inside the shed.Gretel was coerced into doing household chores.She stuffed Hasel's cage with delicious food to make him fatter.
%%She even checked Hansel to see if he had gained weight.Hansel displayed tact by displaying a bone fragment rather than his finger.The evil witch got very impatient after a few days.She chose to consume Hansel's meat.She instructed Gretel to determine whether the oven was hot or not.Gretel played it very tactfully by pretending that she didn't know how to check the oven.Gretel pushed the witch hard from behind as she showed Gretel how to check the oven. She was furious.
%%As the witch fell into the broiler, Gretel quickly locked the stove's top.The oven was where that witch died.Gretel later let go of her brother.Numerous jewels were taken by the two children from the witch's house.In an effort to find the right way to return home, they wandered around again and again.
%%They continued to hear the sound of rising water for some time.They found the river's wide expanse without a boat or bridge when they got there.They were blessed to see a huge white duck.Hansel and Gretel encouraged the white duck to take them across the stream through their tune.They were carried across the river one by one by the white duck.They discovered the actual way to return home on the next side.
%%Their father was ecstatic when they got home.They gave their father each and every one of the jewels they had taken from the witch's house.They were aware that their stepmother had passed away.After that, they enjoyed their lives.
%%A Brief Summary of Hansel and Gretel by Jacob and Wilhelm Grim An impoverished woodcutter once resided close to a forest.His wife treated his children Hansel and Gretel cruelly.There was a time when there was a famine, and the wife told her husband to leave the kids in the forest.Due to his excessive love for his children, the husband was unwilling to do so.Hansel gathered gleaming pebbles at night after learning the plan of the stepmother.When they left for the forest, he dropped those stones.When their parents left them in the forest, they went home in the moonlight, following the shiny pebbles.The following time, their parents also left them in the forest.They were unable to return home at that time.After searching for three days, they discovered a house made of cake, sugar, and bread.They were ensnared by a witch.She put Hansel in a cage so that he could eat.In any case, by the mind of Hansel and Gretel, the two of them were liberated.Gretel even used her clever trick to kill the witch.They returned home via a large river that they crossed with the assistance of a white duck after obtaining numerous jewels from the witch's house.They found out when they got home that their stepmother had already passed away.They gave their father all of the jewels and lived happily ever after.

        %%*SUMMARY:

%%Hansel and Gretel by Jack Zipes

%%This text "Hansel and Gretel" by Jack Zipes is an interpreting text. Jack Zipes has interpreted the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel using a Marxist point of view. According to the Marxist theory, in every society, there are two classes. For example Upper class and Lower class.



%%This theory states that there is always a conflict between these two classes. In this conflict, there is always the victory of the lower class over the upper class at the end.



%%DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY:

%%During the 18th century, there were two classes in every society: the Upper class and the Lower class. During that period, there was the concept of feudalism. The upper-class rich people were feudalists whereas the lower class people were laymen.



%%The feudalists were so greedy by their nature. They used to suppress lower class people a lot. They used to torture the laymen for their profits.

%%Due to extreme poverty, the lower class people used to do misdeeds in society. As: theft, murder, prostitution etc. The upper-class people had accumulated a lot of property in their life whereas laymen had problems with daily meals. Due to all these things as well as famine, people wanted to change feudalism into capitalism at the end of the 18th century. The ideology of feudalism was proved out to be wrong. Lower class people were ready to struggle against upper-class people. All the lower class people hoped for their bright future in capitalism. In that struggle against upper-class people, they got the victory at last. The poor family had changed their lifestyle from extreme poverty to richness.
%%*STORY OF HANSEL AND GRETEL IN RELATION TO MARXIST THEORY:
%%Just as 18th century, there are also two classes here in this story of Hansel and Gretel. The woodcutter's family is a lower class whereas the witch herself is upper class. Woodcutter's economic status is quite bad here in this story just as the laymen of the 18th century. He is also unable to feed his family members properly. The witch has been seen so prosperous in the story just as feudalists of the 18th century. Her house is made of different sweet items which is packed with pieces of jewellery.
%%Here in this story, due to the extreme poverty as well as famine, woodcutter and his wife have done misdeed of deserting their kids in the dense part of the jungle. Just as the famine of the 18th century, the famine has presented the compulsions of lower-class people in the story.
%%According to the Marxist theory, rich people are greedy and so bad by their nature. They oppress the lower class people for their benefit. Here in this story, the witch has shown her greedy nature as well as bad behaviours to the poor children. Her greedy intention of eating Hansel has been seen in the story.

Here in this story, the witch has shown her greedy nature as well as bad behaviours to the poor children. Her greedy intention of eating Hansel has been seen in the story. She has enticed the kids for her benefit.
%%Her bad behaviours have been seen through her acts of imprisoning Hansel in the shed and compelling Gretel in household tasks. Just as the revolt of laymen during the 18th century, the revolt of Hansel and Gretel has also been seen against witch due to her extreme torture. They have killed the witch at last and also taken a lot of jewellery from her house. Taking pieces of jewellery from the witch's house is one of the best examples of the transition phase from feudalism to early capitalism. According to the prediction of Karl Marx, laymen can also go against upper-class people for their betterment.

%%Summary of Hansel and Gretel by Bruno Battelheim Bruno Bettelheim wrote this interpretation of the text "Hansel and Gretel."Here, the essayist has deciphered the fantasy of Hansel and Gretel showing different social and social implications.The bitter reality that poverty, scarcity, and hardship encourage selfishness, cruelty, and bad deeds in society has been presented in this text.
%%Due to a lack of food, Hansel and Gretel feared that their parents would abandon them in the jungle.Their stepmother was a horrible, self-centered woman.Despite his overwhelming love for them, their father was unable to defy his wife's wishes.When he left his children in the thick forest, he felt guilty for himself and his heart broke.Despite their parents' self-centeredness, the children returned home.
%%Social Intentions:
%%Stepmothers are viewed as cruel, conceited, and envious in most societies.Most of the time, they don't like their stepchildren and make their husbands do what they want.Our society has taught us the important lesson that hardships make people brave and mature.In the story, the children grow up and become brave after suffering a lot.The following social meaning is that greed always makes life more risky.The children's avarice puts them in a bind in this story as well.The witch's avarice also results in her death.It means that destruction is caused by greed.The kids learn that being greedy means taking risks.The following social norm is that we cannot achieve anything unless we take risks.In this story, both kids bring a lot of jewelry from the witch's house and face danger and risk.They are both aware that we must endure suffering in order to gain.We additionally know from our general public that everything should effortlessly be possible by co-activity.At the hour of risk, we ought to utilize our psyche rather than enthusiasm.
%%The two children kill the witch and delivery themselves from the witch's snare by doing co-activity.When they are in danger, they use their minds to the fullest extent.
%%Cultural significance:
%%The gingerbread house which the children find in the wilderness is an extraordinary help for the children.The house gives them food and shelter when they are hungry.As a result, the house is regarded as a cultural representation of a mother feeding her children.The story's birds are symbols of peace and kindness, despite the fact that they present the children with both danger and comfort.The story depicts the kindness of the birds.While the white duck takes them across the river, the white bird leads them to the gingerbread house.The act of crossing the water's expanse is a sign of maturity.The children move on to a more advanced stage of development after crossing the river.They are carried across the river by the white duck.They grow financially strong.The family no longer has to deal with them.They gain independence, wisdom, maturity, and happiness.
%%Questions and Responses to Hansel and Gretel by Bruno Battelheim (Important): Do you believe that greed causes destruction?*
%%Answer:
%%Yes, I believe that greed causes destruction.Greed corrupts everything.Everyone ends up in the mess as a result.Here in this account of Hansel and Gretel, covetousness turns into the primary driver behind the witch's demise.Due to her avarice, she entices the children.She longs to consume them.The children witness her cruel treatment.Her avarice has become the primary factor in her fatal end.Greed only makes the brighter future more likely.
%%(Long 2070):Compare and contrast Jack Zipes' Hansel and Gretel with that of Bruno Bettelheim.
%%Answer:
%%Bruno Bettelheim interprets the folk tale "Hansel and Gretel" in a variety of social and cultural contexts, whereas Jack Zipes does so from a Marxist perspective.
%%There are two classes in the story of Jack Zipes: a higher class and a lower class.Jack describes the children and their parents as being of lower social class, while Witch is of higher social class.The story illustrates Marxist ideas like the idea that poverty causes people to behave badly in society.For instance, Hansel and Gretel were left alone in the thick forest.The woodcutter and his wife are forced to leave their children because of their poor financial situation.This demonstrates the compulsion of the lower class.In contrast, the witch's behavior demonstrates social status.Greedy and evil people are wealthy.They oppress people of lower class for their own benefit.For instance, witch demonstrates her avarice to the children through her bad behavior.Her home, which is decorated with sweets and jewels, makes it simple to observe her wealth.She lures the kids for her own gain.By putting Hansel and Gretel in prison, she demonstrates her bad nature.Gretel's clever decision to kill the witch demonstrates the revolt of the lower class.To change their bad reputation, they steal a lot of jewels from the witch's house.
%%The bitter truth that poverty, scarcity, and hardship encourage selfishness, cruelty, and bad deeds (bad works) is made clear by Bruno's story.The stepmother is self-centered and cruel.Despite his love for the children, the father cannot oppose his wife.When he abandons the children in the dense forest, he feels guilty and his heart breaks.Despite the fact that their parents are self-centered, the kids return to the house.The stepmothers in our society are typically mean, cruel, and envious as well.Most of the time, they don't like their stepchildren and make their husbands do what they want.However, the children grow brave and mature as a result of the hardships and suffering.They make it to the witch's house, but it's not easy.The bread and sugar in the house tempt them.They feel happy when the witch gives them a warm welcome.However, when the witch intends to kill them, they understand the risk of eagerness and allurement.They learn that being avaricious means taking risks.When the children defeat the witch and return with pearls and jewels, they learn that suffering is necessary for gain.They learn that they cannot accomplish anything unless they face danger and take risks.The treasure is the reward for the children's danger, suffering, and other difficulties.
