%%Critical Thinking*
%% a. After reading this lesson, have you established your own precept?* Which is it?* Invite your friends to see it.
%%Yes, after reading these lessons, I've created my own precept. These are the main ones:
%%"Anything that happens, happens for good," as Josh Lanyon puts it, "If there was one life skill everyone on the planet needed, it was the ability to think with critical objectivity." "Always stay positive." "Believe in Karma rather than fate." Using logic, support this assertion.
%%The central idea regarding the development of human skills on this planet is somewhat reflected in Josh Lanyon's statement regarding critical objectivity. He has explained the truth about the abilities of people on this planet. Josh possesses critical objectivity and related life skills in this setting. He maintained that the capacity for critical objectivity in human thought was the very thing that necessitated life skills.

%%Throughout their lives, each individual on this planet acquired various life skills. People have been working on skill development and invention development since ancient times. People's capacity for critical objectivity, which runs in tandem with their life skills, both knowingly and unknowingly, made it possible for them to grow and develop.

%%Life skills and critical objectivity always go hand in hand. People are able to think critically because they have used a variety of life skills in their lives. The capacity for critical and objective thinking lies at the heart of all of these life skills.


%%Writing*
%% Send an email to a friend describing a fascinating class you took.
%%From: Send to: binodkumar12@gmail.com Subject: shristi2011@gmail.com I had a fascinating class. Dear Shristi, I hope this letter finds you in good spirits and health. Here, I'm doing pretty well. I'm writing to let you know how my English classes have been going.

%%I believe that the English class provided me with more joys, knowledge, and pleasures than any other class I have ever taken in my school career. I did very well with it, and I got the best grade in the class on every test. In middle school, I learned not only a lot of basic English, but also the personal traits that would shape my interests throughout my education.

%%When I was in middle school, knowing that there would be an English class tomorrow morning meant that I could look forward to another interesting 45 minutes. I established my English-relative interests' group on social media rather than taking other classes like Nepali, Math, or Science, which have greatly benefited my university studies. I don't think any other class has ever motivated me to pursue a scientific result.

%%Collaboration with other students was another important thing I was able to accomplish in the English class. When I started my career as an engineer, it probably helped shape my ability to work in teams. I can still clearly recall my elementary and high school English teachers. They are all extremely patient and instructive individuals. When I repeatedly failed, they advised me not to quit. They give me a lot of self-assurance and mental discipline for success. I'd like to close this email by stating that English class is the only one I used to enjoy the most.

%%Respects,
%%Binod Kumar

%%Thinking Critically*
%% a. In what ways have Nepali families begun to change recently?* Which effects will they have on society?* Discuss.
%%Everything is gradually evolving from traditional culture to modern culture now that we are in the 21st century. Nowadays, people want to feel what they want. In modern societies, they adopt a family-oriented lifestyle. They want to live in a nuclear family and be happy with their child, husband, and wife, but divorce is on the rise in Nepal because people don't understand what a nuclear family is. Male and female members of a Nepali family can control the household and the nation. Everyone in the family, male and female, has the same rights. Everyone in the family understands and is content with one another, and they are able to communicate their ideas and concepts to one another. The widespread practice of arranged marriages, in which family relationships and agreements take precedence over individual choices, is closely linked to young age at marriage in Nepalese families. As a result, a decrease in very early marriage and a decrease in the time between marriage and cohabitation may indicate a shift in marital decision-making and an increase in spouse involvement in the formation of their own marriages. As a result, they will influence society in both positive and negative ways.

%%b. These days, there are a lot of elderly people living in elderly homes in Nepal. Some of them are left behind, while others choose to live there. Do you believe that the culture of Nepali people is changing?* Be specific.
%%In Nepal, taking care of the elderly has emerged as a pressing issue due to the country's rapid population growth. In Nepal, where a value-based joint family system predominated, elderly care has never been a problem. The typical Nepalese's socioeconomic foundation has been this family structure. The elderly were receiving all kinds of support, including emotional, psychological, behavioral, and financial, from their families as part of the shared responsibility to care for them. They were receiving full consideration and respect. They remained in the family until their deaths. With the rising impact of modernization and new ways of life bringing about temporary changes in esteem framework as of late, the joint family is separating into a few dissipated family units. The elderly are frequently forced to live alone or to move out of their own homes and into institutions or old-age homes as a result of changes in family structure, psychosocial matrix, and values.

%%Children's misbehavior, financial difficulties, and a lack of emotional support for the elderly frequently force them to relocate in order to lead trouble-free lives. In addition, for a variety of other reasons, senior living communities are increasingly being considered a superior option. The government and voluntary organizations in Nepal must make arrangements for institutional support and care for the elderly, and emotional support facilities must be established in these homes.


%%Writing* 
a. Compose an essay about how important family is. You can use these guided questions in your essay.*
%%• Why you place a high value on family.
%%• Why family is or alternately isn't significant for society
%%• How you figure families will change from here on out.
%%The Importance of Family In a world where everything is losing its meaning, we must now more than ever recognize the significance of family. Even though the world is getting more and more advanced and modern, the meaning of family and what it stands for have not changed. No matter what kind of family you come from, it doesn't matter. As long as there is love and acceptance, everything is the same. You might be from a joint family, same-sex accomplice family, family unit, it is no different either way. Our family is strong because of the relationships we have with our members. We all have distinct relationships with each member of our family. The most important group in a person's life is their family.

%%It is impossible to overstate the significance of family. They make us better people and play a significant role in our lives. Those who are blessed with families frequently fail to appreciate their importance. However, individuals without families are aware of their worth. Our family gives us strength. It shows us what relationships are all about. They assist us in developing meaningful relationships with others. We pass on the love we get from our families to our own relationships. Furthermore, our families teach us how to communicate better. We build a better future for ourselves when we spend time with our families, love one another, and communicate openly. We learn to better connect with the world when we keep in touch with our families. We also learn patience from our families. Being patient with members of our family can be difficult at times. Yet we continue to be this way out of love and respect. As a result, it teaches us to be more patient in dealing with the world. We feel loved and confident in our families. They are the foundations of our strength that never give way and instead help us grow into better people.

%%We are aware that family is influenced by society. Society cannot exist without families because society is made up of one or more families. We are held accountable for our societal duty by our families. In society, family provides social security. You are introduced to society by your family. Without a family, a person's identity is incomplete in the social world. In addition, I believe that the advancement of modern technology will alter the family in the future; whereas five to ten years ago, every member of the family lived in a large family, the majority of families today live in a nuclear family.

%%b. Some people believe that it is preferable to live in a family unit. Others believe that it is better to live with extended family. What is your opinion?* Compose a paper examining the benefits and drawbacks of both.
%%My opinion is that both the extended family and the nuclear family are better at home because they each have their advantages and disadvantages.

%%The members of an extended family come from all generations. Every member of the family, including the children, grows up in these families believing that they have specific responsibilities and functions to fulfill. They should learn to manage their expectations and demand. In Nepal, staying with extended family is preferred by more people than staying with a single family, and I am also one of those people. The social and emotional bonds that exist between members of an extended family are one of its advantages. There is adequate social and economic security. The children in an extended family receive adequate care, supervision, and education, as well as control over the adolescent issue. An important benefit of extended family is a sense of cultural, traditional, and value protection. There are advantages to having an extended family, but there are also some drawbacks. Over time, it may hinder personality development. Privateness is reduced. There is a possibility of low standards of living. It may be challenging to satisfy each family member's demands and needs. The extended family may experience an increase in dependency and diminished self-confidence.

%%a. England won the football World Cup in 1996. – True b: Italy won the Euro Cup 2020 for the first time. – True c: The English team has more international football championships than Italy. False d: The English team captain claims that losing a game has long-lasting effects. Not Given e. The Italian team was on their home field. False f: The Italian team's goalkeeper had performed the best of any player in the match. Valid

%%B. Answer the accompanying inquiries.*

%%a. For what reason does the correspondent say that Britain is holding on to recuperate its 50 years in length torment?*
%%Since England had not won a title since 1966 A.D., the reporter stated that England is waiting to recover from its half-century of pain. b. How did the Italian players react when they became champions?*
%%During the celebrations, the Italian players reacted by yelling into a television camera, making fun of the famous line from the England team's anthem that starts with "it's coming home."

%%c. Why did Sancho and Saka weep?*
%%Their third penalty defeat in a row made Saka and Sancho cry.

%%d. The penalty shootout has been a difficult experience for the English team for a long time. Why?*
%%The English team has been bitter about penalty shootouts for a long time because they missed three of them.

%%e. Express the commitment of Roberto Mancini to the Italian football.
%%Italy reached a low point in its footballing history less than four years ago when, for the first time in six decades, it failed to qualify for the World Cup. They are presently the best group in Europe and with a public record of 34 games unbeatenunder Roberto Mancini. Mancini went above and beyond to help the Italian football team win the Euro 2020 tournament.

%%f. In what ways does the 2020 Euro Cup final recall the World Cup semifinals of 2018?* How?*
%%The Euro Cup Last 2020 help the crowds to remember the 2018 World Cup elimination rounds since Britain likewise scored ahead of schedule against Croatia then burned through the vast majority of the game pursuing its adversary's midfield prior to losing in additional time.


%%“Every match is a new opportunity.” Critical thinking Let go of its failure and begin over. Does this hold true for the Italian football team when we examine their performance over the past four years, from the time they failed to qualify for the World Cup Football to the time they won the European Championship?*
%%The adage "Every match is a new opportunity" is true. The Italian football team should "put its failure behind it and start over." Italy is always getting better and spending more and more money on its football team. We are able to state that they have continued to improve, and now the football culture in Italy is unparalleled, despite having endured so many difficulties and losses.

%%There is no location on the planet where a typical technician has a higher level of expertise than another. In terms of rehabilitation, strategy, and organization, each casual Italian employee is exceptional. They have a manager who is capable of leading a top club to success wherever they go. They have a high-end club. Juventus has a rich history, efficient association and a supervisory crew that can draw out the best in each player they sign. This level of proficiency, which ought to be the standard, is not reached by many clubs. Consider the following three major European clubs: Manchester City, Real Madrid, and Bayern Munich

%%Under Mancini, Italy has undergone significant transformations over the past four years. After taking the lead with Federico Chiesa, the Azzurri won 4-2 on penalties. However, Alvaro Morata came back from a draw with 1-1 goals, and the Italians won 4-2 on penalties. As a result, we can conclude that the Italian football team has always learned from its previous matches, which has led to their qualification for the World Cup and their victory at the European Championship in these past four years.

%%b. When a team plays on its home field, the stadium crowd gives it a lot of support. Does this help them win the game, or does it put pressure on the players to win and lose?* What is your opinion?*
%%I think the home crowd gives a team playing there a lot of support and confidence, but teams from other places are at a huge disadvantage; based on their climate, fan base, and zone. On their home field, numerous teams have won matches. On the home field, more than 100 teams prevailed.

%%The advantage that the home team is said to have over the visiting team is referred to as "home ground," and it is also referred to as "home field" in team sports. Supporting fans' psychological effects on competitors or referees have been blamed for this advantage. Additionally, the players are accustomed to playing on their home field, making it simple for them to play there regardless of the weather, pitch, or surface. However, the visiting teams are harmed by the challenges of travel or the varying climates or time zones; and in some sports, specific rules that directly or indirectly favor the home team.

%%In my opinion, England's fear and lack of faith caused them to lose the final Euro Cup match against Italy. Since they had not won a match since 1966 A.D., they had less hope and were under more pressure from the fans at home. As a result, getting a lot of support from the crowd in the stadium helps the team win the game and puts pressure on the players to win and lose.

%%Comprehension Respond to the questions below.*

%%a. What exactly is a hyperloop?* How does it function?*
%%A planned train called the Hyperloop would be able to travel at incredible speeds. Because it is enclosed in a tube without air, it travels extremely quickly. There will be no friction to slow the train down because there is no air.

%%b. In what ways is the hyperloop superior to conventional trains?*
%%Hyperloop is a lot of helpful and unrivaled than any customary or a rapid rail. Since the track doesn't have to constantly supply the pods with electricity, it costs less and uses less energy because the pods can leave every 30 seconds, more like a demand-based service.

%%c. Does hyperloop have a track record of success?* How?*
%%Since the original idea for the hyperloop was to use waggons and pneumatic tubes to move mail and packages between buildings, it has not had a successful history.

%%d. Write about Elon Musk and Robert Goddard's contributions to the creation of the hyperloop.
%%Elon Musk, the founder of Space X and Tesla, came up with the hyperloop concept in order to provide extremely rapid intercity transportation. Elon Musk envisions a steel-tube-encased "fifth mode" of transportation in addition to trains, airplanes, automobiles, and boats. His "Hyperloop Alpha" paper in August 2013 rekindled interest in the hyperloop concept.

%%In the early 20th century, Robert Goddard came up with the concept of the "vactrain," which is clearly a model for the hyperloop. Numerous concepts that are comparable have been proposed since then.

%%e. How does air resistance relate to speed?* Explain.
%%The speed of a moving body decreases when there is more air resistance, and vice versa. Due to the absence of air resistance, Hyperloop's speed will significantly increase as it travels through vacuum tubes.

%%f. What is the hyperloop capsule equivalent to?* How are they comparative?*
%%Hyperloop capsules are compared to Boeing 747s due to their similar acceleration to that of the Boeing 747.

%%g. How do passengers experience the hyperloop experience?* How will it be made to be luxurious?*
%%The sensations experienced by passengers on a hyperloop are comparable to those experienced on a lift or passenger aircraft. Each passenger has access to his or her own personal entertainment systems, and the cabin displays stunning scenery, facilitating a comfortable journey.

%%h. Why is the author skeptical of the hyperloop's potential?* What factors determine success?*
%%Hyperloop's prosperity still up in the air on the objections, the neighborhood economy, and the topographical area. Due to the massive multibillion-dollar investment and the projects' ongoing pilot and experimental stages, the author is concerned about hyperloop's viability. Due to a lack of response from government authorities, Elon Musk and Nikola Tesla had previously closed the same concept program.


%%Thinking critically*
 %%a. Is the hyperloop the way of the future or a pipe dream?* What is your opinion?* Legitimize your viewpoint with appropriate reasons.
%%Hyperloop is essentially a concept for a transportation system in which passengers are loaded into pods and transported supersonically through vacuum tubes. Hyperloop is about more than just speed; Additionally, it aims to be eco-friendly.

%%However, the idea, like Hyperloop, is not new. In the 19th century, pneumatic tubes were widely used for mail, money transfers, and parcels. They are still in use today at supermarkets, postal sorting stations, and banks. The idea behind Hyperloop is similar to the pneumatic mail delivery systems. In the past, even flying seemed impossible, but now it's common for us to travel by air. So nobody can say that it's unrealistic in light of the fact that all that which was a fantasy once, is reality now.

%%In conclusion, we can see that the global transportation system of the future may be Hyperloop. Even though it won't happen for decades, this will have a huge impact on everyday people's lives if it happens. We can also hope for economic success, in addition to the convenience and environmental impact.

%%Be that as it may, notwithstanding the enormous commitment, new advances take time, and will be some time until we can go in a case inside a fixed cylinder with a sound just as clearly as a delicate 'SWOOSH.'

%%b. The number of private vehicles in Nepal is growing at a rate that is beyond our infrastructure's capacity. What should be done, in your opinion, to reduce the ever-increasing number of private automobiles?* Discuss.
%%In Nepal, the number of private vehicles is rising at a rate that is faster than the infrastructure of the country and exceeds our infrastructure's capacity. The percentage of Nepalese who own their own automobiles is steadily rising. Despite the fact that it makes their daily lives easier, it has a significant negative impact on the environment. Confidential vehicles ought to be denied since their boundless use debases the climate and expands discharges of dangerous gases that will make serious issues from here on out. There were safety precautions that needed to be taken to control this critical situation.

%%The best strategy is to stop people from buying cars. By creating a system of progressive taxation on automobiles and increasing car tolls, this can be effectively accomplished. The number of cars owned by a family can be limited by the system, and as more cars are purchased, the tax rate on each one can rise.

%%However, these efforts would be meaningless unless they were accompanied by measures to improve Nepal's dreadful public transportation system in order to encourage people to use public transportation. During rush hour, more buses need to run, and the buses need to be made to be more comfortable (by using better cushions, having better air conditioning, having better suspension, etc.). It is necessary to uphold public transportation systems' punctuality and dependability. When maintaining bus and train stations, cleanliness and hygiene must be taken into consideration.

%%The aforementioned strategies must be complemented by efforts to dispel the erroneous belief that public transportation is deplorable. Making public transportation as pleasant and dignified as possible is the most effective strategy for combating this issue.

%%Corrected Passage:*
%%Within the state of Arizona, Rob, along with his family, moves frequently from city to city. After his arrival, one of his first tasks was to find an apartment close to work, as he did not have a car. Usually, there are many different places to choose from, and he considers cost, location, and luxury. If one apartment has a washing machine and dryer and costs four hundred dollars a month, he prefers to rent it over another apartment which has significantly less rent and is located two blocks from a Laundromat. Rob’s family never wanted to live in an apartment on the thirteenth floor, since all of them fear heights. He also tried to choose an apartment with a landlord recommended by former tenants. Everybody knows that it is important to find a responsible landlord. Rob and his wife love to cook together when both are free, so they need a spacious, well-equipped kitchen. Rob often looks for a place with an air conditioner because there are so many scorching days and nights in Arizona. Whenever Rob finds a new apartment, all of his concerns disappear. He felt relieved and called his mother. Someone understands!

%%Critical Thinking*
%% a. In his later years, APJ Abdul Kalam became a well-known aerospace scientist. Do you track down any relationship of his experience growing up days in forming his profession?* Use specific examples from the text to explain.*
%%Indian aerospace scientist APJ (Avul Pakir Jainulabdeeni) Abdul Kalam is well-known. He became a well-known aerospace scientist because his schoolteacher, Sivasubramania lyer, gave him a practical explanation of the dynamics of birds' flight. His early relationships had a significant impact on his career. He was an enthusiastic math student who consistently received full marks. During his study time, he also received full marks in Science. In addition, he would enroll in additional mathematics classes at the residence of his teacher. He always kept himself busy by solving difficult number problems. He found Sivasubramania lyer's practical lecture to be the most memorable experience. He and his friends were taken to the seashore of Rameswaram for a hands-on demonstration of the bird flight dynamics. He had made influential remarks regarding his teacher's actual instruction. He learned how birds balanced their wings and tails so that they could fly. He was determined to study flight dynamics and followed his teacher's instructions when he learned about birds' flight systems. As a result, he became an aerospace scientist.

%%b. Kalam talks about a time when he was treated unfairly at school. By mentioning the incident, he wants to paint a picture of society in a particular light. Discuss.*
%%A tragic instance of religious discrimination at his school is mentioned in his memoir. When he saw a Muslim boy (Abdul) and a Hindu boy (Rameswaram) sitting on the same bench in the classroom, his new teacher demonstrated his discriminatory behavior. He was close friends with the Hindu community's Rameswaram Sastry. Abdul was unaware of the religious discrimination against Muslims and Hindus. Hindus and Muslims were subjected to severe religious discrimination at the time. The new teacher's actions accurately reflected the society of the time. He forbade Abdul from sitting near his Brahmin friend because he could not accept the friendship between a Hindu boy and a Muslim boy. Abdul was extremely upset by this. Abdul wants to convey a picture of a society divided between Hindus and Muslims through this incident. The majority of people, including educated individuals, believed in partition, though only a few individuals denied such divisions.


%%Writing*
%% Use the following guidelines to write a brief autobiography about your childhood.*
%%I was born in a small village in Nepalgunj District's north-east. My family is middle-class. There are five my relatives including me. First, my reputable tailoring father, and then my lovely housewife mother. An older brother and a younger sister are also members of my family; both of them are enrolled in school.

%%My daily routine focuses on studying and classes because I am a student. I usually get up at 6:00 a.m. to start my day by showering, brushing my teeth, and getting ready for class. After that, I review the day's material and check my notes. My classes generally used to begin by 8:00 am and finishes by 1:00 pm. I used to regularly attend classes. I go home after classes and spend some time with my friends. When I get home, I typically take a nap until 4:30 p.m. I play outside after I've had a nap. I typically return by six and take a bath. After that, I get ready to study, and I go to bed by 9:00.

%%My siblings and I used to play a lot together. The games we used to play are very fond memories of mine. We especially liked to spend the evenings playing sports in the park. We played various games each day, such as football one day and cricket the next. I treasure these childhood memories of playing in the park. Most importantly, I have a very clear memory of this time when my family and I went for a picnic. We had an amazing day when we went to the zoo. My mother brought delicious meals that we ate at the zoo. That day, my father took a lot of pictures. The memory is so vivid when I look at these pictures that it seems like it was just yesterday. As a result, when I'm feeling down, my childhood memories bring me joy.

%%h. Do you believe that using a QR code to pay can solve all kinds of payment issues?* Why?*
%%Because it is quick, safe, and simple to create, I believe the QR code-based payment can be a solution to all payment issues.
%%Critical thinking a. In Nepal, some department stores, shops, and business establishments in urban areas have begun to implement QR code payment systems. What can be done to make it easier to find?* Discuss.
%%The Covid-19 pandemic has also significantly improved Nepal's Scan and Pay service using a QR code. The support for the contactless payment system comes from people who are concerned about their hygiene. Scan and Pay services offered by evolving digital payment service providers like Fonepay, IMEPay, Khalti, QPay, and SmartQR also encourage QR code payment.
%%QR code payment systems have the potential to significantly influence the transition from the informal economy to the formal economy. However, before Nepal can take full advantage of e-payment, it must overcome obstacles in numerous infrastructure and behavioral characteristics. Another major problem for a reliable digital payment service is interoperability. The digital economy's ecosystem may become unbalanced as a result of the rapid expansion of several PSOs and PSPs. A unified payment switch is necessary to avoid this obstacle.
%%Nepal's digital economy could benefit greatly from QR code payment. A head start for QR code payment could come from the government giving digital payment systems more priority and the central bank promoting this system.
%%This transition can also be influenced by public relations events and campaigns to raise awareness. It is necessary to take into account developments in the infrastructure, such as faster internet connections and increased user accessibility. Interoperability for digital payment services should be achieved through collaboration between payment service operators, banks, financial institutions, and traders.
%%b. Digital payments are replacing cash in the payments landscape. The consumer benefits from the ease and convenience of digital payment. Is it possible to use these cashless payment options in Nepal?* Discuss.
%%Digital payment systems are difficult to implement in Nepal, but not impossible. Before Nepal can take full advantage of e-payment, it must overcome obstacles in numerous infrastructure and behavioral characteristics. Although the number of people using the internet is impressively increasing, it is still insufficient to process an established digital economy.
%%QR code installment frameworks can assume a significant part in changing casual areas into the proper economy. A head start for QR code payment could come from the government giving digital payment systems more priority and the central bank promoting this system.
%%This transition can also be influenced by public relations events and campaigns to raise awareness. It is necessary to take into account developments in the infrastructure, such as faster internet connections and increased user accessibility. Interoperability for digital payment services should be achieved through collaboration between payment service operators, banks, financial institutions, and traders.
%%Offering customers a single point of access to all e-payment services, including QR code payment, should be the ultimate objective.
%%Writing A. Use appropriate punctuation to break up this paragraph.
%%It had been snowing all day in New York, making the day bitterly cold. I went outside to play in the snow while Mr. Tim cooked. Since our ski trip to Sweden last year, we hadn't seen much snow. Mrs. Smith was correct on the grounds that she had said that we'd see snow. We had a wonderful time there the next day, didn't we?*
%%B. Write a piece for the news about Nepal's digital payment systems.
%%Nepal's digital payment systems are gaining traction as a result of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. A bright future for online payment in Nepal is ensured by the development of digital payment platforms and the growing preference of consumers for electronic payment.
%%How does digital payment work?*
%%Digital payment is unquestionably becoming a fad and growing in popularity. The reason is straightforward: it's easier. Why not transactions in an era when businesses are moving online?*
%%Major Use of the Digital Payment System in Nepal You can find QR codes in many banks and financial institutions (BFIs) and other retail and service establishments, including department stores and small shops. Using a digital wallet, you can use a QR code scanner in supermarkets to make payments. QR codes are also being used by shops and vendors in the area for quick payment. Digital payment methods are also available for grocery shopping at fruit and vegetable markets.
%%The Nepal Rastra Bank reported that there were 372,176 digital transactions between the middle of December 2020 and the middle of January 2021. In a similar vein, the transaction cost Rs. 1.245 billion. The subsequent month saw an increase in the number of transactions to 535,790 and a total of Rs 1.712 billion, indicating a clear increase in the use of digital payment methods.
%%Future and Obstacles The transition to electronic payment services like QR code will take some time. To encourage these platforms, PSOs like eSewa have been providing QR payment services without charging any additional fees during transactions. Because this generation has access to a variety of media that can raise awareness of the significance of digital payment, the number of users is anticipated to rise rapidly in the future, but not sufficiently to process an established digital economy. Another major problem for a reliable digital payment service is interoperability.
%%In conclusion, QR code payments have the potential to significantly boost Nepal's digital economy. The public authority giving greater need to computerized installment frameworks and the national bank to advance this framework can be an early advantage for QR code installment. Offering customers a single point of access to all e-payment services, including QR code payment, should be the ultimate objective.

%%Answer the following questions.*

%%a. In what manner does the author describe the waste management system in Japan?*
%%According to the author's description of the Japanese waste management system, the residents of his neighborhood drop off their household trash at designated locations on street corners three nights per week, wrapped in neat bundles like gifts, and it disappears at dawn.

%%b. What are the two reasons that sodaigomi is a part of Japanese culture?*
%%The existence of sodaigomi in Japanese culture can be attributed to two factors: One is the typical Japanese home's small size, and another is the Japanese's need for purity and freshness.

%%c According to the author, how do Japanese people feel about the idea of purchasing used items?*
%%The author asserts that the thought of purchasing secondhand goods makes the Japanese feel embarrassed.

%%d. How does the use of used items differ between Malaysian and Japanese culture?*
%%In contrast to Japanese culture, where heaps of clean, new-looking merchandise are thrown on the street, no one in Malaysian culture throws anything away. In contrast, shoppers in Japan appear embarrassed at the thought of purchasing secondhand items, despite the enthusiastic bids of several customers in Malaysia.

%%e. Why did the author find the sodaigomi pile to be awkward?*
%%The author felt awkward at the sodaigomi pile because he had never been taught that in Japanese culture, anything that is clean, whole, and usable is thrown away.

%%f. How many articles did the author bring one after the other to his house?*
%%The author generously included as many provisions as he could. He started with a standard, low Japanese tea table. He then brought a shiny new bell for one of his sons' bicycles, a small but pretty wooden cabinet, a Naugahyde-covered barstool, a metal toolbox with a complete set of wrenches and screwdrivers, and a lacquer serving tray.

%%g. Why do most people search the trash pile "dark of the night" for items?*
%%The majority of people try to find things in trash cans "in the dead of the night" because nobody will notice and they won't be embarrassed by it.

%%h. How did the author's family incorporate consumer goods into Japanese culture?*
%%By working late into the night to gather the essential materials or goods that were thrown out in the sodaigomi pile, the author's family assimilated Japanese culture in how to use consumer goods.


%%Thinking critically*
%% a. Will you collect articles from sodaigomi if you ever visit Japan?* If not, why not?*
%%Indeed, I would have gathered articles from sodaigomi on the off chance that I end up being in Japan sometime in the not so distant future. I live in a country where people only buy new things when they are old, broken, and don't work right. Therefore, living in Japanese culture and adhering to the sodaigomi custom is not my thing. It hurts to go from a world in which we didn't have any household items and couldn't bring ourselves to buy new ones at overpriced prices in the store to one in which we saw tons of clean, new-looking goods just sitting on the street. I would live a happy life and save a lot of money by purchasing items from sodaigomi. Therefore, I will definitely collect articles from sodaigomi rather than trying the new one.

%%b. Nepal also has a few secondhand shops. However, they lack much interest from the public. What method is best suited for managing secondhand goods in Nepal?*
%%Due to the affordability and environmental and ethical advantages, some customers enjoy purchasing and selling secondhand goods. However, many Nepalese people are not particularly interested in them. So to empower recycled shopping in Nepal following things ought to be thought of.

%%1. Consignors should receive guidance from secondhand stores on which brands and products to consign with and partner with that sell well.

%%2. Starting with the item's original value and then lowering it in proportion to wear and tear and usage volume is the best way to maintain a fair price.

%%3. Increasing the number of people who buy and sell on these shops can be facilitated by providing additional support, such as consignment consultations that offer guidance on pricing, photographing, and shipping of items.

%%4. Secondhand shops have a lot of fans on social media, so they should try to reach as many people as possible. 


%%Writing*
 %%A: Outline the three R's—reduce, reuse, and recycle—in garbage management in a paragraph.*
%%The three R's—reduce, reuse, and recycle—are commonly referred to as the "3Rs." These acronyms stand for "reduce, reuse, and recycle." It basically consists of a set of steps for effective waste management. Choosing to use things carefully to reduce waste is a form of reduction. Reusing is the repeated use of things or parts of things that still have parts that can be used. Recycling is the process of making use of waste as a resource. All three of the three R's contribute to reducing our waste. They save energy, space in landfills, and natural resources. Additionally, communities save money and land by avoiding landfill waste disposal with the three R's. Environmental laws and public opposition have made it more difficult and more expensive to locate a new landfill.

%%B. Waste management is a major issue in the majority of Nepal's cities. Compose a letter to the manager to be distributed in the day to day paper proposing the approaches to 'Taking care of Trash Issues.'
%%12/24 Amritnagar Tole, Kalanki, Kathmandu, January 26, 2021 To the Editor, Kathmandu Post Sub: Regarding the coverage of "Solving Garbage Problems" in the news.

%%Dear Sir, I beg of you to give me a small space in your popular and widely distributed newspaper. I am writing to you in order to bring the issue of garbage management in the majority of Nepal's cities to the attention of the general public and the government's concerning authority. We are aware that we have a significant garbage issue. If waste is not separated, it is abundantly clear that neither energy nor material will be of any use. However, our waste management system fails here.

%%In order to address the larger issue, the waste issue must be addressed on a smaller scale and consolidated. Waste-pickers already make a significant contribution to addressing this issue. We must utilize their capabilities. I Got Garbage is an IT platform that can help wastepickers develop business models. The government could provide subsidy and equip each home with a composter rather than picking up and dumping garbage from each one. Because it is a dated concept, landfill sites will never be an option for dealing with solid waste in cities. The most common strategies for reducing waste in landfills are reduce, reuse, and recycle. If the government works with pig farmers in the cities, 80 percent of the organic waste that is littering the streets can be used. Why aren't the authorities using this method, I wonder?* The city will not become cleaner as long as governments attempt to clean it in the same way they always have and promise to do it better this time. We require something very different.

%%I hope the authorities in question will immediately take the necessary actions.

%%f. What findings did the study provide regarding the connection between the brain and laughter?*

%%j. When the author says, "there is always a meaning to it," what does he mean by that?*
%%At the point when creator says "there is consistently a significance to it" he implies that giggling is rarely unbiased and consistently have an importance in spite of the fact that it is by all accounts trifling, vaporous and futile.

%%Critical thinking*

%%a. Do you agree that ‘the couples, who laugh together, stay together?*’ Is it important for married couples to have the same sense of humour?* Why?*
%%Yes, I agree with the statement that “the couples, who laugh together, stay together.” A sense of humour is an attractive trait. There is abundant cross cultural evidence that shows that being funny makes you more desirable as a mate. Simply having a funny bond doesn’t mean you two are the perfect match – apparently being able to laugh at the same things makes your partnership even stronger. A good sense of humour makes a person more attractive. Laughter is called the best medicine not without a reason, and this holds true for couples who might be going through stressful times. Studies have proved time and again how laughter helps release feel-good hormones that help to relieve stress. So, it’s important for married couples to share good laughter and have the same sense of humour whenever they find themselves bogged down by trouble.

%%b. Some people believe that sometimes crying is good for health. Do you believe it?* Give your reasons.
%%Crying is a natural response humans have to a range of emotions, including sadness, grief, joy, and frustration. Yes I believe that crying is good for health. Medical benefits of crying have been known as far back as the Classical era. Thinkers and physicians of ancient Greece and Rome posited that tears work like a purgative, draining off and purifying us. Today’s psychological thought largely concurs, emphasizing the role of crying as a mechanism that allows us to release stress and emotional pain. When we cry, we let out tons of emotions that allow our body and mind to reboot after you release all those emotions. Crying is particularly important during periods of grieving. It may even help to process and accept the loss of a loved one. People often report feeling better after they cry. That could be because crying forces us to pay attention to what triggered us and work through our emotions and thoughts. Crying might also help in understanding what’s important to us, especially if we cry over something that upset us unexpectedly. By this we can say that crying is an essential form of relief and hence it is good for health too.


%%Writing*

%%B. Write a description of your favourite comedian explaining his/her personality, acting, performance and uniqueness.*
%%Charlie Chaplin

%%Charlie Chaplin was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the silent era. He is mostly famous for his screen persona “the tramp”. Born on April 16, 1889 in London, Chaplin is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. He had been a productive and creative film maker for about 75 years before he died in 1977.

%%Chaplin suffered from poverty and hardship in his childhood. He was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. His mother struggled financially when his father was absent. When he was 14, his mother was sent to a mental asylum.

%%Chaplin’s first performances were at music halls as a stage actor and comedian at the age of 19. He went to the USA where he was scouted for the film industry, and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage, and continued to hone his craft. By 1918, he was one of the best known figures in the film industry.

%%Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture.

%%Comprehension of Class 12 English Notes A: Select the best response.*

%%a. According to the author of the preceding text, Julia Hill continued to engage in tree climbing for an additional two years.

%%b. The phrase "Julia had occasional visitors" indicates that she occasionally received a few visitors.

%%c. To discourage her from running her campaign, the logging company provided round-the-clock security around the tree.

%%d. Ms. Hill began to converse and sing with the loggers because she had an unwavering love for all of nature's creations.

%%e. Julia Hill ascended the tree 738 days later, just as her demands were about to be met.

%%B. Respond to the questions below.*

%%a. Who precisely was Julia Butterfly Hill?* How was Hill's campaign successful?*
%%Julia Butter Jill was a person who spent more than two years in a 200-foot-tall redwood tree to raise awareness of the ongoing clearcutting of California's remaining redwood forests. When she started getting sporadic visitors, her campaign started to gain popularity.

%%b. What prompted Hill to launch her massive campaign to preserve redwood trees?*
%%She was seized by the spirit of the forest when she got to the redwood forest. When she saw the redwood trees being cut down, she fell to her knees and started to cry. She sat for a long time and wept before deciding to launch her massive campaign to preserve redwood trees.

%%c. What kind of comforts did Hill have to live in the tree?*
%%Hill was able to survive in the tree thanks to a single-burner propane stove, a solar-powered cell phone for interviews with the media, and a sleeping bag. She lacked both luxuries and necessities.

%%d. Did Hill's perspective on life alter as a result of her car accident?* How?*
%%Yes, Hill's perspective on life's value evolved after her car accident. She claimed that the event served as a wake-up call. Prior to the accident, her primary focus had been her job, but it became clear to her later that people's value is not found in their bank accounts or stock portfolios; rather, it is found in the legacy they leave behind.

%%e. Natural disasters are caused by deforestation. What textual evidence do you have to support this?*
%%It is true that natural disasters are brought on by deforestation. According to the text, the cutting of redwoods destabilized the hillside and caused the mudslide that brought trees, stumps, and other debris into the town, displacing seven families.

%%f. In what manner did the logging company attempt to discourage Hill during her initial sit-in?*
%%In the early stages of Hill's sit-in, the logging company employed security guards who were available round-the-clock to harass Hill and ensure that her support team could not deliver her supplies. She was menaced with a helicopter at a perilously short proximity. Luna's outer branches were struck by the fallen tree, almost causing Hill to fall. She was abused verbally, threatened with rape, death, and violence, kept awake by floodlights, and bugles and air horns were blown all night long.

%%g. How were the caprices of nature unpleasant to Slope?*
%%She had more issues than just the logging company. One of her most terrifying experiences was a 16-hour windstorm with 70 mph winds that ripped apart the tarps around her and even tore off huge branches from the tree. Her hair stood straight up when lightning struck nearby during an electrical storm. Hill didn't like the whims of nature in this way.

%%h. Why did the author decide to write a book review of Hill's?* Do you believe the author is a proponent of environmental sustainability?* Be specific.
%%The author of this review of Hill's book wanted to bring attention to the problem of deforestation. Through his review, he wants readers to become aware of the negative effects of deforestation and what they can do to stop it. Yes, I believe the author supports environmental sustainability.


%%Writing A*
%% Write a review of a recent book, movie, or other media.*
%%The Wayback Machine The Book's Title: The Way Back Machine The book is written by: 3. H.G. Wells Country: The United Kingdom Language: 5. English The initial publication was made by: In 1895, William Heinemann visited London.
%%6. Genre: Seventh Science Fiction Novel The Book's Price: Rs. 300
%%8. The Publisher's Name: Publications from Dover Copyright's year and edition: April 3, 1995
%%10. No. total pages: 80
%%11. Art of writing: 12. Narrative Characters: The Storyteller—Hillyer, Eloi, the Morlocks, and Weena 13 Plot: The story is about a Victorian scientist who says he invented a device that lets him travel through time and has visited the future, arriving in London in the year 802,701. The narrator talks about the Traveler's lecture to his weekly dinner guests about how time is just the fourth dimension and shows a tabletop model of a machine that can travel through the fourth dimension. He reveals that he has constructed a machine that can transport an individual through time and returns to dinner the following week to tell a remarkable story, becoming the new narrator.

%%14. Summary: The Time Traveler is speaking to a group of men, including the narrator, about his theory that time is the fourth dimension. The Time Traveler creates a tiny time machine that vanishes into thin air. When the guests return the following week, their host hastily enters, exhausted and disheveled. After dinner, they sit down, and the Time Traveler begins his narrative.

%%15. My perceptions: Both the time traveler's account and the machine used by the time traveler are described in such hazy terms that it is difficult to accept them as scientific instruments. He is only gone for a short time due to the nature of time travel, and the only "proof" of his travels is a crumpled flower. The reader can't help but wonder if any of the novels are actually true because the narrative is told twice in a row. Was the time traveler able to experience what he claimed, and did he in fact engage in such chronological heinousness?* Or does he just want to warn people about the current state of society by using an imagined future?* But the truth is that neither the journey nor the truth are important: It's only the end result.

%%B. On Friday, a speech competition will be held at your school. "Let's save the trees and protect our environment" is the speech's topic. Draft a discourse utilizing the accompanying prompts.

%%Good morning, everyone! I am grateful that you have given me the opportunity to speak on such an important subject as "Let's Save the Trees and Protect Our Environment." Air is the answer that always comes to mind when asked about the most crucial component for survival. Air is essential to all living things, including humans and animals. The trees which involve 32% of the world's surface give us this air.

%%The planet's trees purify the air we breathe, acting as our bodies' lungs. We inhale clean air because trees are present. As trees breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen which fills in as the significant everyday routine wellspring of all experiencing creatures. The air we breathe is cleaner and more pure the more trees there are on the planet.

%%We are paying an unfortunate price for mankind's attempt to outlive nature. The drive for civilization and modernization is causing irreversible damage to the environment and the planet as a whole. The planet suffers as a result of man's disregard for nature, and we bear the negative effects. Let's find out how.

%%The majority of the time, the path to civilization involves depleting natural resources.

%%Man sees trees as obstacles to modernization—that is, as obstacles that stand in the way of building more roads and buildings. As a result, they frequently engage in deforestation, also known as tree felling. As trees are cut down, more houses and offices are built on the land.

%%Numerous unnatural phenomena disrupt the natural balance as a result of deforestation. Global warming and air pollution rise as a result of deforestation. The untimely removal of tree roots, which results in soil erosion, deteriorates the soil quality and causes animals to lose their homes and shelters.

%%As their number continues to rise, it is essential to plant more trees so that future generations can enjoy clean air. Due to the imbalance it experiences, the planet will be unable to support future generations if deforestation continues.

%%Avoiding deforestation and moving toward afforestation, or planting trees, is the best approach to this issue. We should all work together to save our planet, our home. A single tree planted can save so many lives.

%%It is past due that we take action to safeguard the environment, which provides food for all living things. When trees are saved, they not only save lives but also the planet. We should all live by the motto "save trees, protect the environment." Let's leave the next generation with a green planet. We can protect the environment by spreading the word and taking action to save trees.

%%I appreciate your patience with me!

%%Comprehension of Class 12 English Notes*
%% Answer the following questions.*

%%a. What does it mean to have a CV, and why is it important to have one?*
%%The Latin term curriculum vitae literally translates to "course of life." In practice, it is a document that details a wide range of your personal information, experiences, and accomplishments in relation to your career.
%%It's important because it gives people a chance to think critically about their careers and make plans for the future. It is necessary for job applications, promotions, and research funding applications.

%%b. Is the same CV applicable to all job openings?* If not, why not?*
%%Although it is true that the same CV applies to all job openings, it is preferable to make minor adjustments to ensure that the CV highlights your most relevant skills and qualifications in accordance with the job description and makes use of job listing terminology.

%%c. What are the various regions where CV can help you?*
%%When applying for jobs, trying to get promoted, or trying to get research funding, you need a good CV. When you are asked to be an external examiner for a course or research thesis, for example, it is helpful; for audits of research and teaching activities; if an external professional body needs to validate your faculty or department, or in other words, if someone needs to evaluate your own professional competence or that of your colleagues as a whole.

%%d. By "staying CV" and "leaving CV," what do you mean?* Which one would you make for yourself when you were a freshman?*
%%A 'remaining CV' is that of the great college resident, including a lot of panel work and organization, peaceful consideration of understudies, a weighty showing load as well as a dependable exploration record. A "leaving CV" is one that reflects the interests of a new employer and will likely highlight research accomplishments while still demonstrating your general competence and willingness to perform academic tasks.

%%I would foster a leaving CV for myself as a first year recruit.

%%e. How can you create an effective CV?*
%%One can draft a decent CV with the assistance of your companions, family, guides and more experienced partners. A fundamental system can be utilized to structure your memories and thinking. You should ask those who know you and/or understand what an academic CV should look like to give you feedback on your draft CV. You can make a good CV this way.

%%f. What distinguishes an academic CV from a non-academic CV?*
%%Academic and non-academic CVs differ significantly in two key ways. One is that academic CVs are typically longer than non-academic CVs, and this trend continues throughout a person's career. A second, and perhaps more fundamental, difference is that non-academics are frequently encouraged to make largely unproven assertions about their qualities and skills rather than listing verifiable accomplishments when applying for middle management positions.


%%A person's confidence cannot be expressed in writing, so a CV may not accurately reflect their skills and abilities. What, in your opinion, should employers do to find the best candidates for the job?*
%%Because confidence cannot be expressed on paper, it is true that a CV may not accurately represent a person's skills and abilities. Candidates who are able to communicate well are preferred by employers. Communication skills, both verbal and written, are essential for almost all jobs. Employers can, in my opinion, divide the selection process into three steps rather than relying solely on a piece of paper to evaluate a candidate's abilities. The first thing you need to do is get to know the willing participants. Businesses can present their organization agreements to the members and in the event that they want to work under the circumstances, they can be welcomed for additional cycle. Cover letter explanation is the next step. Employers should evaluate a candidate's character, abilities, behaviors, skills, and character during this step to determine whether or not they could succeed in the workplace. Calling the selected candidate to join colleagues at the weekly Friday lunch where everyone "talks shop" is the final but not least step. Teamwork is a requirement for employees. Therefore, only one individual should not attend their interview. Everyone who is already employed by the company ought to have the opportunity to speak with them and decide whether or not they would like to collaborate with them. Instead of solely relying on CVs, employers should conduct these activities to select the most qualified candidates.
%%
%%b. If employers offer employment opportunities based on a candidate's resume, how can recent graduates compete with experienced competitors?*
%%Sadly, having a degree and doing good work may not be enough to get the job you want in today's competitive job market. You need to stand out from the crowd and make a good impression on your potential employers in order to get one step closer to your dream job than other graduates.
%%
%%While having a solid degree in a particular field may be required for some jobs, most employers are looking for more from potential employees than just excellent exam scores. They need applicants with character and the right mix of delicate abilities, in regions, for example, relational and authority. A lot of recent graduates don't know how to write a good CV. The majority use the same resume template, resulting in CVs with similar layouts. Break the mold and be creative to make yours stand out. If you want to work in the creative industry, you might want to choose something a little out of the ordinary or visually impressive that will really set it apart from the competition. A recent graduate can compete with more experienced competitors by doing this.

%%Thinking critically*
%% a. Do you think that walking helps us understand who we are?* Give justifications for your position.*
%%Yes, I think walking helps us understand who we are. Walking lets you do both things at the same time. It boosts your emotional well-being while also providing the physical benefits of exercise. Anxiety, depression, and bad moods can all be helped by it. It also has the potential to improve self-esteem and lessen signs of social withdrawal. Walking also helps us clear our minds and come up with new ideas. It facilitates the free flow of ideas and is a straightforward strategy for enhancing creativity while simultaneously engaging in physical activity. We interact with our inner selves and evaluate ourselves, our actions, and our work while we walk. Because of this, we actually realize who we are. Self-realization, which can occur when we are by ourselves and immersed in the natural world, is necessary for self-understanding. Therefore, it is accurate to say that walking aids in self-awareness.
%%
%%b. Consider one of your interests. How does this pastime relate to your inner self and psyche?*
%%Hobbies are seen as indicators of a well-rounded person who is capable of balancing their personal and professional lives. I only have one hobby. However, it consumes all my spare energy. I've always enjoyed reading and been a voracious reader.
%%
%%Despite my preference for fiction, I make it a point to read at least one non-fiction book every few months.
%%
%%When I was ten years old, I wrote my first book, "Famous Five Go to Kirrin Island." The ability of my hobby to transport me to various locations while I am still seated on my couch is something I truly value.
%%
%%I frequently select this low-cost travel option! I just started going to book club meetings.
%%
%%We are a group of fifteen people who get together on the third Sunday of each month to talk about the books we have read that month.
%%
%%It's amazing how a few lines can elicit such a wide range of feelings and opinions from so many different perspectives.
%%
%%My leisure activity has caused me to foster logical reasoning and liberality.
%%
%%My imagination has also grown in new directions as a result of reading. I would never, ever give it up for anything!
%%
%%c. A lot of people make careers out of their hobbies. Is it beneficial to turn a passion into a career?*
%%Yes, it is true that many people make careers out of their hobbies. However, what I believe is; For some lucky people, the big decision of whether to turn a hobby into a career is a godsend, but for others, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Making a hobby into a business can be a messy endeavor, whether you want to become a sole trader, set up a limited liability company, or become a freelancer. Hobbies are crucial to personal development and enjoyment, and the last thing you want to do is transform a form of escapism from the daily grind into something stressful and demanding. In conclusion, if a person truly enjoys their hobby, they can easily turn it into a career; otherwise, they will suffer greatly.

%%a. Featuring the benefits of strolling, Henry David Thoreau says, "An early morning walk is a gift for the entire day." Write an essay about the benefits of taking a morning walk.
%%Benefits of going for a morning walk The modern world is plagued by numerous issues, including mental illness, mental tension, and other mental health issues. Similarly, some people's lives are like a never-ending rush from one job to another. In addition, very few people care more about their health than they do about their work or daily responsibilities. However, there are ways to regain our health, and going for a morning walk is one of them. Additionally, due to its efficacy, it has the potential to decrease the number of health conditions worldwide.
%%
%%We have been taught since childhood that "a man is healthy, wealthy, and wise if he goes to bed early and gets up early." This isn't just a saying; morning walks make men wise and healthy.
%%
%%In addition, it improves our physical condition and shape, protecting us from numerous diseases. In addition, the morning walks all contribute to a sense of equality among the population.
%%
%%Above all else, going for a morning walk gives you energy, keeps you from being lazy, helps you develop a positive attitude, is good for your organs, especially your heart, and gives you time to plan your day. The best time to go for a morning walk, according to research, is between three and seven in the afternoon.

%%In conclusion, we can say that going for a morning walk is very beneficial to the body. Additionally, it aids in mental and physical wellness. In addition, everyone, regardless of age, should try to incorporate a morning walk into their daily routine. As can be seen, people who walk every day live longer than people who don't walk in the morning.

%%
%%a. What signs do we see these days that we are very self-conscious about who we are?*

%%
%%b. In what ways have we celebrated our individual identities?*
%%By giving ourselves a real name, we have celebrated the fact that we have our own individual identity.
%%
%%c. Could it be said that we are, people, truly one of a kind?* If not, why not?*
%%No, we humans aren't really special. Because uniqueness is such a common characteristic of living things, there is really nothing particularly distinctive about it. The peculiarity can't be exceptional and general simultaneously.
%%d. How do fish identify one another?*
%%Fish can smell each other to know each other.
%%e. What purpose does individuality serve?*
%%Self-preservation and individuality maintenance are functions of individuality.
%%f. What does having two different selves reveal about our identity?*
%%We learn that unity and cooperation with one another are necessary for survival and existence from the misinterpretation of two selves.
%%g. What does the story of the nudibranch and the medusa demonstrate?*
%%The story of the nudibranch and the medusa serves as an illustration of the significance of coexistence, cooperation, helpfulness, collaboration, and belonging. Additionally, it conveys the significance of friendship and mutual dependence on one another for survival.
%%h. Why does the author find the idea of creatures like the nudibranch and medusa troubling?*
%%The author is disturbed by the idea of creatures like the nudibranch and medusa because it gives him an odd feeling and makes him feel like he is in a dream with a vague and bizarre idea.
%%i. What does it mean for the author to say, "They remind me of the entire earth at once?*"
%%By stating that "they remind me of the whole earth at once," the author is implying that it is extremely difficult and bizarre to justify the relationship between living things and non-living things in the world, and that the more one tries to understand, the more confused they become.

%%
%%a. How does the creator make parody on the advanced thought of 'oneself' in view of distinction, freedom and uniqueness?*
%%The author of this essay satirizes the contemporary concept of the "self" in terms of uniqueness, independence, and individuality. The self and what nature can teach us are the subjects of this essay. The author begins by highlighting the human tendency to foster a sense of self-worth based on individuality, independence, and uniqueness.
%%
%%The author demonstrates in this section how closely related the nudibranch and medusa in the Bay of Naples are. A mature jellyfish consumes a tiny newly-hatched slug one bite at a time until the snail takes over and the jellyfish is reduced to a round "successfully edited parasite" attached to the skin near the mouth of the snail. Last but not least, the tentacles until the jellyfish is eaten, reducing its size, and the snail grows to match.
%%
%%The thesis of this essay is that these two creatures can't live apart; they can only survive together. The story of the nudibranch and the medusa serves as an illustration of the significance of coexistence, cooperation, helpfulness, collaboration, and belonging. Like the relationship between anemones and crabs and medusa and snail, we are all significant, and each of our lives is influenced by another. It also demonstrates the significance of friendship and mutual dependence on one another for survival. This provides the author with justification for the claim that modern people's pride in the idea of individuality, independence, and uniqueness is not applicable to real-world situations.

%%
%%Writing A*
%% Write a 250-word essay on "Independence vs. Interdependence."*
%%Independence versus interdependence Humans typically classify themselves as either individuals or groups. People's motivation and cognitions are typically influenced by these self-conceptions, which typically arise in their minds. In most cases, people's perceptions of themselves and their relationships with others are split into two camps. The first is the independent self-concept, in which an individual believes that he or she exists independently of other people. An individual's behavior characteristics, preferences, and attitudes are all included in independent self-concept. The self-concept of interdependence, in which a person is affiliated with or feels connected to other people, is the second perception. The advantages of interdependence over independence are examined in this paper. "The joy of a functioning interdependent relationship can be tremendous," according to Gish Jen.
%%
%%Interdependent self-concept emphasizes shared responsibilities, in contrast to independent self-concept, which places emphasis on individual responsibility apart from society as a whole. The fact that people in a society rely on one another for survival and mutual development is the central tenet of the interdependence self-concept. Self-instilling interdependence instills the notion that mental development endeavors are not undertaken alone. Individuals likewise offered help for each other to socially develop. By encouraging individuals to assume various roles and contributing to society's development and growth, an interdependent self-concept also encourages responsibility sharing.
%%
%%For overcoming fear, interdependent self-concept is also essential. Interdependence, in contrast to independence, which pits an individual against the rest of society, encourages cohesion among society members and aids individuals in experiencing lower levels of fear and insecurity. Positive emotions, which can lead to fear in individuals, can be alleviated by realizing that one has the support of others. Support for one another is just conceivable in a general public where individuals feel near one another and the general public is described by elevated degree of reliance.

%%The concept of interdependence places an emphasis on how well people get along with and relate to the social norms that are already in place. People's thoughts, feelings, and actions are not significantly influenced by their intrinsic characteristics. Jen, on the other hand, asserts that "we need both the interdependent and the independent self," pleading for people from opposite self-concepts to accept and comprehend one another.
%%
%%
%%B. Write an article for the newspaper highlighting the growing individualism in contemporary Nepali society.*
%%By Ramesh Thapa on March 12, 2019, Increasing Individualism in Modern Nepali Society Individualism is a moral stance, political philosophy, ideology, and social outlook that places an emphasis on the intrinsic worth of the individual. Individualists advocate that the individual's interests should take precedence over those of the state or a social group and oppose external interference with one's own interests by society or institutions like the government. They also value independence and self-reliance. In contrast to totalitarianism, collectivism, and more corporate social forms, individualism is frequently defined.
%%
%%Individualism is rapidly growing in Nepalese society today. The shift toward white-collar jobs and rising incomes, education, urbanization, and socioeconomic development appear to be the primary causes of this rise. Nepal is one of the few nations that defied the global trend toward individualism, as these factors consistently lead to gains in individualist beliefs and practices in the decade that follows.
%%
%%Changes like increased education and prosperity are generally well-liked and reflect not only gains in wealth for the already-wealthy but also for the desperately poor. Selfishness and wealth are frequently conflated. Individualism follows. This is in part because collectivism, the opposite of individualism, emphasizes close social ties and an interconnected view of the self rather than independence.

%%b. In what way does the author describe Frank's connection to the twin towers?*
%%Frank's attachment to the twin towers is portrayed by the author as a means of livelihood and passion.
%%
%%c. In what ways did the two families become close to one another?*
%%Because of their children, the two families became close friends.
%%d. What did Frank think of the towers, according to Nicole?*
%%Nicole claims that Frank viewed the towers as an incredible human festival. Frank was blown away by the towers' magnitude, inventive design, and resourcefulness. He once stated that they were constructed to withstand light airplane impact.
%%e. Why did Frank want to assist the tower inhabitants following the attack?*
%%Because few people were aware of the tower's strength after the attack, Frank wanted to assist the occupants.
%%f. Despite knowing that the building was on fire, why did Frank not comply with Nicole's request?*
%%Even though Frank was aware that the building was on fire, he did not comply with Nicole's request because he was confident that he could assist the injured on their way to safety without injuring himself.
%%g. After the attack, who did Frank call from the building?*
%%After the attack, Frank called his sister Nina, who lived on West 93rd Street in Mahnattan, from the building. How did Nicole feel when the first tower fell?*
%%Nicole believed that the first tower's fall signaled the beginning of a nuclear war. She felt like she was in the middle of a fog that was as blindingly bright as a snowstorm on a sunny day and everything went silent.
%%i. When Frank's children heard that their father was missing, did they take it seriously?* Why?*
%%When Frank's children heard that their father had vanished, they were too busy playing games to be serious. 
%%Critical Thinking a. Each year, ruthless attacks result in the deaths of numerous innocent people. How should governments, in your opinion, respond to these threats and make the world a safer place to live?* Talk about it with your friends.
%%Yes, ruthless attacks result in the deaths of numerous innocent people annually. To manage and control such circumstances, the government must be accountable. It ought to seriously consider protecting their citizens from such vicious attacks. The following are the actions that the government ought to take to safeguard its citizens from such attacks and make the world a safer place to live:
%%
%%– The political parties and leaders of each government ought to remain stable.
%%– Border restrictions ought to be implemented.
%%– Armed forces ought to be stationed in a number of locations with a high probability of attack outbreaks.
%%– The peace treaty is signed, but it is not followed up on. So every country ought to attempt to keep up with harmony.
%%– In the event of danger, people ought to be relocated to a safer location.
%%
%%b. Rache and violence are fundamental to both civilization and history. They cannot be managed or ignored. Do you concur or disagree with this assertion?* Present your rationale.
%%The assertion that vengeance and violence are essential to civilization and history is correct. Violence is the use of physical force to harm, abuse, damage, or destroy, and revenge is associated with harm and damage. The German vengeance on June 28, 1919, is also responsible for the outbreak of World War II. It humiliated and blamed Germany for World War I, imposed heavy debt payments on Germany, and ended the war between the German and Allied Powers with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. Germany took revenge in 1939, and that was the beginning of World War II. We know from our past that retaliation and violence only make things worse. Subsequently, it can't be overlooked, yet all the same just made due.

Finally, the lunar eclipse began at 11:30 p.m. and ended at 1 a.m. I was accompanied by a few friends who had chosen to see it. We spent one and a half hours looking up in the sky, which was a little challenging but ultimately rewarding.
%%B. Human life does not proceed as planned. You might also have experienced a variety of memorable events. Write a 500-word essay about "An Unforgettable Event in My Life."*
%%It is true that happiness and sorrow coexist in our lives. I cannot be an exception to the rule. The day I felt like there was only sadness in the world is still fresh in my mind.
%%
%%After my tenth-grade board ex-examinations, I was enjoying my vacations. Alisha, who is my closest neighbor, was staying with me. Her parents had traveled to Kathmandu for her grandfather's major surgery. My parents and I did our best to prevent her from missing her parents and keep her content. We spent the entire day playing there.
%%
%%Her parents called one evening while we were playing our little brain game to tell us that her grandfather's operation had been successful and that they were going to fly back the next day. Alisha was overjoyed when she read it, and I felt her joy as well.
%%
%%Alisha did not sleep that night. She kept track of the hours until early morning. My father took us to the airport after we got dressed quickly. When we got there, we noticed something was wrong. During landing, the Yeti Airlines flight from Kathmandu had gone down. Ambulances and fire tenders were fleeing the scene. Our spirits fell. From shock, Alisha fainted. My father took us back home in a taxi and hired one.
%%
%%We anxiously awaited my father's return with her parents in good health. Alisha's condition got worse, so my mother went to the doctor. I sat by her side silently hoping that things would improve. Even though their names were on the airline's passenger list, my father returned to say that her parents had vanished. Alisha became difficult to control because she was so hysterical.
%%
%%She stated that she desired to visit her residence. I chose to go with her while my mom would before long follow. She dashed for her house as soon as she was on the street. I yelled for her to slow down when I saw a car going too fast. She failed. She was badly injured as she lay on the road as the vehicle continued on without stopping.
%%
%%She was rushed to a nearby hospital by us right away. She may recover gradually, according to the doctors who examined her, but they did not confirm her recovery. The intensive care unit took her in.
%%
%%I went back to my parents' house. The phone rang as soon as we entered the room. The hospital had called to let us know that Alisha had passed away. I began to feel numb and shed tears. I continued to deny the veracity of what I had heard.

%%Once more, Alisha's parents answered the phone to inform them that they had missed their flight due to car trouble on the way to the airport. My heart was not moved when I heard that Alisha's parents were still alive.
%%
%%When Alisha's parents got home the following day, they found out that their daughter had passed away. However, nothing was possible. I cry out, "Alisha, why did you have to die?*," every moment of that day still flashes before my eyes as I recall the incident. You have become a dear friend to me.

%%Write True or False after each statement. Be specific in your response.*
%%a. According to the author, his father was a perfect member of the family. False When he was drunk, he used to verbally and physically abuse his mother.
%%b. The author wished he could forgive his father, but he was denied the chance. False due to his numerous stresses and pressures.
%%c. It merits pardoning an individual if he/she understands his/her errors. True d: In the 1960s, South Africa had a dual educational system. True e: The author came from a large family. False due to the author's small family of wife and two children.
%%f. The author was disappointed that he was unable to communicate with his father. True g. The author asserts that all of our glories and splendors are fleeting. True B, respond to the questions below.
%%a. How does the author recall the environment of his family when he was a young boy?*
%%The author recalls the environment of his family when he was a young boy, when his father physically and verbally abused his mother.
%%b. Why is the author more at fault for the system than for his father?*
%%Because the system was to blame for his father's stresses, pressures, and traumas, the author places more blame on the system than on his father.
%%c. How is the forgiveness principle implemented?*
%%The idea of forgiveness does not depend on what other people do. It is the path to self-healing and harmony and peace. It alleviates our suffering and grants us mental and emotional freedom. It demonstrates that, as a matter of selfishness, people forgive themselves rather than helping others.
%%d. How interprets the author's interpretation of his children's noise, squalls, and outbursts?*
%%The author interprets his children's noise, squalls, and tantrums as a comprehensive list of failures, irritations, exhaustion, and other emotions. for the families.
%%e. For what reason did the author decide to send his kids to school in Swaziland?*
%%He was dissatisfied with the subpar education provided to black children by the Bantu Education Act of South Africa and made the decision to send his children to school in Swaziland.
%%f. In what sense does the author define life?*
%%The author says that human life is a wonderful mix of goodness, beauty, cruelty, heartbreak, interference, love, and many other things.
%%g. According to the author, what determines a man's character?* Is it his upbringing or his environment?* Explain.
%%As indicated by the creator, heredity or climate shapes a man's personality. Every child's birth is the same. A child is neither a liar nor a rapist at birth. He or she is not born with hatred or violence in their blood. No one is born with less goodness or glory than we are. Therefore, a man's character is not shaped by his lineage. Our personalities are shaped by our surroundings.
%%h. Why is it important for us to forgive?*
%%Because it is the means by which we can free ourselves from the mistakes we have made in the past and move into the future without being affected by those mistakes, forgiveness is an important part of our lives.
%%a. Desmond Tutu once stated, "Forgiving is not forgetting; Actually, it's remembering and not using your right to respond. It's a second chance at a fresh start." Does this quote apply to this piece of writing?* Analyze.
%%"Not forgetting is forgiving; it is really recollecting recalling and not utilizing your entitlement to hit back. It's a second chance at a fresh start." is one of Desmond Tutu's well-known sayings. Whether or not a person or group has harmed us, we can let go of feelings of resentment toward them through forgiveness. It does not imply forgetting or denying the seriousness of an offense against us. Even if the author is willing to apologise, he is still a victim of his father's domestic violence in this section of the text. Desmond Tutu recalls his father's pain for his mother. When he was younger, he wanted to hurt his father back. However, later on, he accepts his father's forgiveness, arguing that his father's rude behavior was caused by the way white people treated black people in South Africa. Therefore, forgiving does not imply forgetting; rather, it entails remembering and not retaliating.
%%b. According to the author, the three hardest words to say are "I am sorry." What relevance does it have to your life?*
%%Making errors is a normal part of life. However, accepting it and expressing regret is the most difficult task. The author interprets "I am sorry" as the three hardest words to say in the text. Empathy is the capacity to empathize with others and imagine ourselves in their position. We need to work on developing this. It requires modesty. Too frequently, we focus on our own emotions. Recognizing that it's not just about us is empathy. Others are important. Additionally, they have feelings that are significant. We validate them as human beings by offering our sincere and genuine apologies.
%%When I hurt other people, the three words "I am sorry" are the hardest for me to say. I don't go near the people who have been hurt by me to apologize and keep my distance from them. I don't talk to them or get close to them unless they ask me to. I am such a proud and sensitive individual. I want people to come close to me and say "sorry" because I am easily hurt by other people and feel sad. But I don't always realize how much my bad behavior affects them. I find it difficult to say, "I am sorry," as I feel very uneasy. As a result, for reasons such as pride, shame fear, lack of awareness, superiority, lack of comprehension, overwhelming guilt, etc. Also, saying the three words "I am sorry" makes it hard for me.

%%Writing*
%%The author discusses South Africa's second half of the twentieth century dual education system based on race. In Nepal, we also have public and private schools. What should be done to ensure that all Nepali citizens have access to equal education?* Write a few paragraphs outlining your thoughts.
%%Equity in education has improved significantly in Nepal. Inequitable access and high dropout rates are caused by a variety of factors, including income, location, gender, language, and disability in the majority of nations. Since the middle of the 1800s, many issues have plagued Nepal's educational system. Nepal's first education system was only available to wealthy families, and Nepali people did not get an education until the 1950s, one hundred years later. Nepal's education system, which is still in its infancy, did not really begin to incorporate the use of technology in the classroom until 2007.
%%Children in Nepal's public schools must have access to safe drinking water both at home and in school to illustrate the challenges they face. The children have trouble concentrating and comprehending the material at hand due to the lack of water and high temperatures. Children in Nepal's public schools, as a result of this and child malnutrition, are less likely to succeed and are more likely to fall behind or drop out. Given these facts, Nepal's education system is still relatively new and growing, but access to public schools is still limited. Women are kept out of continuing education, limiting their access, which causes families to fall into poverty. This situation is made even worse by the additional factors of caste and ethnicity in Nepal. Even though the caste system was legally abolished in the 1960s, its legacy continues to have an impact on the population for many years to come, and people who are considered to be low-caste frequently face disadvantages in terms of both their economic situation and their social standing. Children from these castes did not previously have access to schools. This is now changing as a result of government initiatives like campaigns to increase school enrollment and scholarships for children who are disadvantaged.

%%Comprehension of Class 12 English Notes: Answer the following questions.*
%%
%%a. What motivated the author and his classmates to go to Bandipur?*
%%The author and his classmates decided to go to Bandipur because they were all tired of the fast-paced lifestyle in Kathmandu.
%%
%%b. What makes Bandipur unique?*
%%Bandipur is unique because it is a place where the cool, cobbled Newar settlement of old Nepal still exists.
%%
%%c. In what ways has Bandipur's economy developed recently?*
%%In Bandipur, the traditional type of business has given way to tourism-related ones.
%%
%%d. Why do locals who have moved to Kathmandu frequently visit Bandipur?*
%%Bandipur is frequently visited by locals who have moved to Kathmandu and are seeking respite from the bustling city life.
%%
%%e. In Bandipur, how do locals learn to speak English?*
%%The local schoolchildren in Bandipur teach the locals how to speak English.
%%
%%f. When the author says that "time stops in the town of Bandipur," what does he mean by that?*
%%When the author says, "time stops in the town of Bandipur," he is referring to the town's natural beauty, which draws everyone's attention in such a way that they lose themselves in its uniqueness and beauty.
%%Thinking critically a. It would appear that the author believes that rural life is superior to urban life. Would you concur with him?*
%%I concur with the author that rural life is superior to urban life. First and foremost, I am very attracted to the peaceful surroundings. The village is frequently referred to as a tranquil haven where visitors can unwind and get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Additionally, because there are fewer people and vehicles in the rural areas, they are less crowded. Because the natural beauty of a village is still well-preserved, the scenery there is beautiful. As a result, the village's residents can relax and enjoy the outdoors.
%%
%%This condition is completely different for people who live in cities, who have a busy life and frequently feel annoyed because they are under a lot of stress. The environment in the countryside is cleaner. Due to the abundance of undeveloped land and vegetation, the village's air is clean and fresh. Because there are fewer factories and automobiles in the rural area, air pollution is lower. Better facilities and education may be advantages of living in the city. Nevertheless, I am still of the opinion that living in the city has fewer advantages than living in the country.
%%
%%b. Is the writer simply observing Bandipur through the eyes of a city tourist?* Why?* Why not?*
%%No, the author's perspective on Bandipur is not that of a typical urban tourist. He doesn't just visit Bandipur as a tourist in the city. Being taken care of with his furious life in Kathmandu, he visit there alongside his companions to feel the serene climate and astounding magnificence of the spot by his heart.
%%
%%Bandipur is a rural municipality and hilltop settlement in Nepal's Tanahu district. This spot is the focal point of fascination because of multiple factors. The majority of tourists come to this location because of its genuine and original beauty. The writer was also drawn to Bandipur because of its breathtaking beauty and setting. He and his friends are astonished by the local customs, cultures, and organic, delicious food at Bandipur. With his friends, he takes pleasure in Bandipur's various locations. He feels a strong sense of connection to this place, where he can get all the drinks he's been looking for. He learns about people, places, and the tourism industries there. Bandipur is where the author spends his best time. As a result, he looks more like a city tourist than just a tourist.

%%Comprehension of Class 12 English Notes: Answer the following questions.*
%%
%%a. Iqbal wanted to sleep in the afternoon for what reason?*
%%Iqbal had spent the night sitting on his bedroll in a crowded third-class compartment of the train and wanted to sleep in the afternoon.
%%
%%b. In the train, how did people interact with one another?*
%%The train was filled with very loud reactions from passengers.

%%c. Why did the book Iqbal was reading cause the compartment to shake?*
%%Because the book Iqbal was reading was written in English, people thought it was wise, worthy of praise, and prestigious to read in English. This caused a stir in the compartment.
%%
%%d. Why was Iqbal required to provide personal details for clarification?*
%%Because the other passengers in the train considered Iqbal to be an intelligent and wise individual, they insisted that he reveal his personal details. As a result, Iqbal was required to provide clarification with his personal details regarding his background.
%%
%%e. Who was Meet Singh and what did he answer to Iqbal?*
%%Meet Singh was a minister of Gurudwara and he answered to Iqbal about the homicide of an individual resident maybe by a town's dacoit named Jugga.
%%
%%f. In what ways, in Meet Singh's opinion, did Jugga Sing differ from his ancestors?*
%%Meet Singh says that Jugga Singh was different from his ancestors because his ancestors were also criminals like him in the past. They never pillaged their own village or caused harm to its inhabitants. In the past, they protected the villagers from dacoits. Jugga, on the other hand, robbed and even killed members of his own village. He murdered a member of his village.
%%
%%g. In what way does the author demonstrate Meet Singh's character's contradiction?*
%%The creator shows logical inconsistency in Meet Singh's personality by saying that Meet Singh was not irritated by Jugga's demonstration of killing individual resident and as a cleric of Gurudwara, he even needed to swear on the blessed Granth to guard Jugga from the wrongdoing of homicide.
%%
%%h. What made Hukum Chand successful in his career and who he was?*
%%Hukum Chand, also known as Nar Adami, was the Deputy Shahib. He was successful in his career because he pleased his Shaibs and received successive promotions.
%%
%%
%%Critical Thinking*
%%a. Because he spoke English, most people refer to Iqbal as Babu Sahib. Are English-speaking Nepalis treated with respect?* In the context of Nepal, discuss the significance of acquiring English skills.
%%Yes, English-speaking Nepalis are treated with respect. English is considered an elite language in Nepal. The majority of Nepalese believe that a person's class and social status are closely linked to their proficiency in English. You will be viewed as a very respectable individual who has accomplished great things in life if you speak English fluently. It's almost like going to a store dressed up and getting all the attention of the salespeople. You are likely to receive less attention if you shop at the same store in regular clothing. A book's cover often tells a lot about it. If the book's cover is in English, Nepalese people will buy it right away rather than just review it.
%%
%%b. Do you concur with Iqbal's remarks regarding punishment and crime?* What, in your opinion, should the state, society, and individuals do to maintain social order?*
%%Indeed, I concur with Iqbal remarks on wrongdoing and discipline. State, society, and individuals must collaborate to cultivate and sustain a culture of peace.
%%
%%The individual is the beginning of peace. We must realize that we are not powerless as individuals and that individual power can have an impact. We must accept our individual responsibility to put an end to war and build a culture of peace. We need to understand that peace is more than just not having war. History demonstrates that war is ineffective as a means of conflict resolution because it consumes both human and financial resources. A process of individual and collective participation is necessary for peace. Justice, equal rights, and equal opportunities are required.
%%
%%Next, keeping social life peaceful and orderly relies heavily on society. Every family in a society needs to work together to make it a good and safe place to live. In order to maintain society's peace and order, a specialized team ought to be put together. This team must carry out its responsibilities for maintaining order and determining the criminals' punishment.
%%
%%In addition, the state plays a crucial and accountable role in preserving social order. In order to maintain social order and peace, the state must enforce various regulations. By reducing state-sponsored crime and violence, it ought to concentrate on social safety. Criminals and crime must be subject to stringent state regulations. It ought to handle how to properly punish criminals as well.
%%
%%For social peace and order, the state, society, and individuals should do these things.
%%
%%
%%A. Meet Singh calls Jugga a badmash in his writing. These people may also exist in your neighborhood. Write a paragraph about the person.*
%%During my time in school, I met a man who was initially so kind to me. He turned out to be the dishonest person I had ever met later. We quickly became good friends, so I used to tell him all of my little and big secrets. I discovered over time that he was not worth that. He used to tell his stupid friends all those things about me and make me look bad. I was completely broken and frustrated when I found out that. I forgave him, despite the fact that he had not even sincerely apologized, because I was strong. I believe that we should forget, forgive, and move on when dealing with such individuals. However, don't forget what you've learned from them.
%%
%%B. It's possible that you traveled by train or bus. You may have had different experiences while traveling. Describe your unforgettable journey in a letter to a friend.
%%Date: 2078-10-13 Pokhara-7, Kaski I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits, Pratik. I am thrilled to share with you one of my experiences traveling to my hometown of Sankhuwasabha by bus. On October 10, 2078, I traveled in a Manakamana Yatayat with the number Nine Hundred and Ten. I boarded at 5:00 in the morning and arrived at my destination at 6:00 in the evening.
%%
%%The entire journey was amazing and calming. Even though it appears as though trees are far away from us, the view from the windowpane looks so peaceful and calming. The journey is made even more exciting by waterfalls nearby and the fresh air coming in through the window. The price of the ticket was reasonable and not too expensive. The cost of the meals was included in the price of the tickets. I got a seat in the corner. Individuals going alongside me were cordial to such an extent that we played a card game/ludo/chess while voyaging and the time elapsed without any problem.
%%
%%I believe that every person should have this experience at least once in their lifetime. That day, spending time on the bus was both reassuring and enjoyable. In the coming days, I will undoubtedly plan another trip and will ask you to join me. Take care in the meantime.
%%Aayusha Sharma, we love you.

%%
%%a. How does Hellen Keller feel about people who are blind or deaf?*
%%Hellen Keller is of the opinion that, in contrast to deafness, blindness separates people from things.
%%
%%b. Why is Beethoven compared to Milton, Van Gogh, and Toulouse-Lautrec by the author?*
%%The author draws parallels between Beethoven and Milton, Van Gogh, and Toulouse-Lautrec due to the similarities between their disabilities and Beethoven's.
%%
%%c. When and how did Beethoven realize that he was hearingless?*
%%When Beethoven was 27 years old, he realized that he was deaf. He lost his ability to hear high-pitched sounds at that time, which is a sign of nerve deafness. He realized that he had some kind of impairment, like being deaf.
%%
%%d. When he realized he was deaf, what kind of psychological effects did he experience?*
%%Fear, low self-esteem, emotional chaos, an increase in isolation, self-neglect, and a lack of confidence at work followed his realization that he was deaf.

%%e. How did he overcome his thoughts of taking his own life?*
%%With the assistance of his interest in music and his life's ethics, he overcame his thoughts of suicide. Additionally, he had read that a man should not give up his life because he can perform numerous other noble acts throughout it. He was motivated by these things to overcome thoughts of suicide.
%%
%%f. How did he come to terms with being deaf?*

%%

%%
%%j. How did Beethoven express his inner conflict?*
%%Beethoven expressed his inner conflict by avoiding social events, distrusting his closest friends, and repeatedly imagining himself making suicide attempts.
%%
%%
%%Critical thinking*
%% a. Beethoven had suicidal thoughts several times, but he did not kill himself and continued to write music. Write a 150-word monologue from Beethoven's point of view about his thoughts of suicide and his determination to live.
%%I was the party's lifeblood. even in the absence of a party. One was made by me. People laughed at me. I laughed myself silly. I put in a lot of effort to make myself laugh. Lord, my laughter could be heard a block away.
%%
%%"Isn't that Beethoven something?*," People would comment, Always content. Consider him. Always with a grin. I'm feeling very helpless and alone in this situation. My condition has kept me apart from my family and coworkers. They have negative thoughts about me. I'm viewed as a deaf man by them. I would be wasting my entire life trying to bring music to life and make people all over the world proud. This is a life situation that I can't stand. I have no intention of being cured. Maintaining the motor running, the horn honking, and the smoke pouring out was exhausting at times. Sometimes all I wanted to do was relax. Thus, I made a mistake today. I left on my own. That's what I'll do, I decided at that point. I'll simply stop. I'll relax.
%%
%%I decide later that day that it would be bad to kill myself. I should attempt to vanquish these self-destructive contemplations. I ought to reflect on my interest in music and the morality of life. Men shouldn't give up on life because they can do so many good things, according to some. Why am I thinking those things?* I can make everybody feel that I am ordinary, that I am adapting, and that I am fine. I think to myself, "Suicide is not a long-term fix for a short-term problem." Human life is valuable and significant. I'm ready to forget about these awful thoughts! I'm prepared for the real world. If I can't listen to other people, it doesn't matter. I'm going to pay attention to my feelings and sounds inside!
%%
%%b. What made Beethoven one of the world's greatest musicians—divine inspiration or arduous practice?* Give justifications.
%%No, Beethoven's status as one of the world's greatest composers was not the result of divine inspiration but rather a dedication to his craft and consistent practice. The German pianist and composer Ludwig van Beethoven is widely regarded as one of the greatest musical geniuses of all time. His inventive compositions expanded the scope of sonata, symphony, concerto, and quartet by combining vocals and instruments.
%%
%%Some of Beethoven's most important works were written during the last ten years of his life, when he was almost completely unable to hear. His personal life was marked by a struggle against deafness. He went on to make a lasting impact on the music industry on his own. He got very sad and serious because he was deaf. He didn't give up his love of music and carried on with his creative endeavors despite that suffering as well. Even after becoming deaf, he continued to produce some of his best music. His music career reached its peak and made him quite popular not only in his country but all over the world due to his dedication to music and rigorous practice. It has been asserted that he alone brought music into the Romantic era from the Classical period. However, that is not sufficient. I strongly believe that Beethoven deserved and defined his own musical era.
%%
%%
%%Writing*
%% Which Nepali musician is your favorite?* Write a biography of about 300 words for them.
%%Swar Samrat Narayan Gopal Guruacharya Narayan Gopal was born in Kathmandu in 1996, Bikram Sambat (BS). His parents were Newars. His father wanted his son to become a classical musician like him. Narayan Gopal had an early interest in music, but he wasn't particularly interested in classical music. He is referred to as "Swar Samrat" in Nepal and is regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons in the country. Due to his numerous tragedies, he is also known as "King of Tragedy." Additionally, he sang Nepal Bhasa.
%%
%%Narayan Gopal is without a doubt the most well-known and well-known singer in Nepali music. Narayan Gopal is the person most commonly associated with Nepali music when people think of or discuss it. He is the singer for the majority of people. In his own right, he was also an accomplished composer of music. He not only had a great voice but was also very adaptable. He was able to sing songs from every genre with the range of his voice. The flute, harmonium, and sitar are often used to create elaborate orchestrations in his songs. These are some of his most well-known songs: Euta Manche Ko Maya le Kati, Jhareko Paat Jhai, Yo Samjhine Man Cha, Saawan ko jhari bani, Manche ko Maya, and a lot of other songs are also available.
%%
%%He has performed over 500 songs, many of them in movies, ballets, and plays. His songs are mostly melodies. It is said that he chose which songs to sing very carefully. Although 500 songs are not a lot for someone of his caliber, they are exceptional in some ways—whether it's the depth of the lyrics or the excellent performances. He has received a number of national honors and awards, including the Trishakti Patta and Chinnalata Puraskar, to name a few, for his contributions to Nepali music.
%%
%%His continued popularity is demonstrated by the high number of albums sold. Considerably over 10 years after his passing, his tunes are similarly enjoyed, cherished and sung. His legacy endures.

%%Comprehension Respond to the questions below.*
%%
%%a. For what reason does Audre Lorde believe Mary achieved some kind of victory at the University of Boston?*
%%Audre Lorde was of the opinion that Mary had some kind of victory at the University of Boston because she was overjoyed to see so many women attending the speak-out, and the show of united power would give them more room to develop and be themselves.
%%
%%b. Why does Lorde appreciate Mary?*
%%Lorde is grateful to Mary for giving her the book Gyn/Ecology, which is full of important, useful, generative, and provoking information. She gains strength and benefits from the book.
%%
%%c. How did the author perceive the treatment of black women by white women?*
%%The author has a very negative impression of how white women viewed black women. She claimed that the white women were unable to converse with the black women or hear what they were saying. She finds the behavior of white women to be lengthy and discouraging.
%%
%%d. According to Lorde, why did Mary not portray black women as goddesses in her book?*
%%Lorde claims that Mary deliberately chose to focus only on the ecology of Western European women, which is why she did not portray black women as goddesses in her book.
%%
%%e. Why did Lorde believe that she misspoke?*
%%Because she only used her words to testify against Lorde as a woman of color, Lorde believed that she had used her words improperly.
%%
%%f. According to Lorde, how were women, particularly those from the black community, valued less?*
%%Lorde believed that women, particularly those from the black community, were undervalued because they were treated as ghettos by a white woman who only dealt in a patriarchal Western European context.
%%
%%g. In what ways does Mary view white women?* Does Lorde concur with Mary's perspective?*
%%Mary considers non-white women to be inferior to white women. Her presumption is that nonwhite women's stories are only noteworthy as decorations or examples of female victimization, and that the herstory and myth of white women are the only legitimate and exclusive herstory and myth of all women to call upon for power and background.
%%Lorde does not share Mary's perspective, no. Lorde disliked Mary's views, which portrayed black people as decorative and useful objects while ignoring their suffering and oppression, which demonstrated the supremacy of white feminism over black feminism.
%%
%%h. Tell me about Afrekete. What link does it have to this lesson?*
%%The collective voice of the black lesbian writing tradition is Afrekete. It interfaces with this example as the writer needs to interface every one of the people of color in the field of dark composition.
%%
%%Thinking critically*
%% a. "The oppression of women transcends race or ethnicity." Are you in agreement?* Give a reason for your decision.
%%"There are no racial or ethnic barriers to the oppression of women." Indeed, I concur with this assertion.
%%
%%Women have fought for years to be treated equally and to be paid the same as men. Men get better treatment, occupations, and preferred pay over ladies, which shows separation towards them. Ladies keep on battling against the segregation around the world. A form of intolerance is created when women's equality is under attack. Uncertainty within oneself can result from women not having the rights they deserve.
%%
%%Women never had equal rights in history, which explains why some still face sexist discrimination against men. Women still face violence, discrimination, and institutional barriers to equal social participation despite significant progress in the fight for gender equality. Because of gender inequality, women are treated differently than men; this demonstrates that women do not have the same social status as men. Equal pay for equal work ought to exist, but unfortunately, women are regarded as less competent than men. Due to their belief that women shouldn't be educated, many nations deny women the right to education. Education is restricted to poor women because many cannot afford it. Because governments prevent women from achieving their educational goals, it is frequently not an option. Women have suffered greatly as a result of all of these factors. They have long been the victims of oppression that transcends race and ethnicity.
%%
%%b. Why is it critical to challenge our values and beliefs?* How are they arranged in an individual's mind?*
%%It builds character, honesty, compassion, acceptance, and strength to question our beliefs and values. Most of the time, people avoid challenging their own beliefs because they fear that doing so will weaken them. We are being dishonest with ourselves if we think this way because we already doubt the veracity of our claims. We can determine not only whether our beliefs are accurate, but also the logical (positive and negative) consequences of our ideas in the world, by challenging them objectively and observing from the perspective of a third party or person. When we question someone else's views on a subject, we should also evaluate our own. Acceptance is cultivated when we discover that we are mistaken. This builds strength when we realize we are wrong, change our beliefs, and admit our error. As a result, it's critical to question our values and beliefs.

%%Writing B. Write an article on "The Status of Women in Nepali Society" for a national newspaper.
%%The Situation of Women in Nepalese Society on January 26, 2021: Nepal is a very diverse nation in terms of geography, culture, ethnicity, and religion. The majority of communities in Nepal are patriarchal, despite their diversity. A woman's father, husband, and son all have a significant impact on her life. The legal system further reinforces these patriarchal practices. The patriarchal social system, values, the state's protection of women's rights, and state policy for women's development all influence women's status.
%%
%%However, women's relative status varied from ethnic group to ethnic group. Women make a significant contribution to the economy, but their traditional role is often overlooked because it is taken for granted.
%%
%%Nepalese people have one of the lowest health statuses in South Asia, and this is especially true for women. One fifth of women marry between the ages of 15 and 19. The number of women who pass away as a result of their pregnancies has been extremely high.
%%
%%According to statistics from across the country, women have a literacy rate of 30%, while men have a rate of 66%. Only 24.95 percent of women enroll in higher education. Additionally, women are less likely than men to participate in technical and vocational education. This is because of the accepted practices and culture that we follow moreover. Because girls in rural areas are regarded as "paraya dhan," or the property of others, they are denied access to education.
%%
%%The majority of the work done by women is not regarded as economic activity. Consequently, only 45.2% of women and 68.2% of men are considered economically active. In Nepal, very few professional women are employed. Although they may study law, few are able to practice.
