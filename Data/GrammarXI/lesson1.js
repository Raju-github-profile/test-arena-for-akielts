%%Critical Thinking *%%a. Every child has the right to a high-quality education.How can we guarantee that every child has this right?*Discuss the government's and parents' roles in ensuring that all children can attend school.
%%Answer:
%%Children are the nation's future.Everyone needs to take into consideration every child's right to an education in order for the country to progress.Every child ought to be entitled to a high-quality education.The training appropriate for youngsters is additionally referenced in the constitution of most nations.Literate people are essential to any nation's development.As a result, this growth can be seen to have begun with children's education.
%%Our government has prioritized children's education within the context of our nation.Our constitution also mentions the significance of children's education.A substantial budget has been approved specifically for the education of children.However, children continue to be absent from Nepali schools.This is primarily due to the infrastructure of numerous schools and the extent of poverty in Nepal.I believe that it is particularly significant for the public authority to really take a look at this multitude of fundamental things to elevate the state of schooling.Training should be created so that kids understand their right to quality instruction.The education of children should be the responsibility of the government.It must proceed with a variety of plans, particularly for schoolchildren.Scholarships, delicious breakfasts, and attractive classrooms and textbooks should all be provided.It ought to establish a fine climate to make all youngsters come to school all the more routinely.In addition, parents must pay close attention to their children's education at home.They should fulfill their essential responsibilities to encourage their children to attend school.Every child can go to school as long as the government and parents focus on the aforementioned issues.
%%    
%%b. Do you believe that there is still gender discrimination when it comes to providing education in our nation?*What methods would you recommend for overcoming this kind of discrimination against females?*
%%Answer:
%%Yes, I believe that our nation still discriminates against providing education to daughters and sons.Nepal is a patriarchal nation where males are seen as superior in most societies.Males are still regarded as family leaders in our societies.There aren't many priorities for women.Everywhere, the idea of subjugating one's sex remains widespread.The patriarchal decision determines the education of girls in our societies.When it comes to getting an education, girls have less of a chance than boys do.Girls are compelled to marry young in rural societies.This is one of the biggest forms of discrimination that societies have ever seen.In order to get rid of this kind of discrimination against girls, I suggest the following methods:
%%1.The government ought to establish stringent regulations prohibiting the early marriage of girls.
%%2.It ought to give girls' education preference.
%%3.Girls should be pushed as hard as boys to get an education.
%%4.Guardians shouldn't predisposition young ladies in that frame of mind of schooling.
%%5.To encourage girls to attend school, the government should provide financial assistance.
%%6.Women should not be forced to perform household chores.
%%7.They ought to have the right to a good education.
%% WRITING*
%% a. Think back to your school days.Describe an event in three paragraphs that you always remember.*
%%Answer:
%%Every person treasures the time they spend in school.Everyone remembers their school days.We go through a variety of experiences during school hours.In my case, there are numerous recollections of events.However, one particular occasion stands out among all of them, and I'd like to share it with you.
%%The day I proposed to a girl named Gita from my class when I was in the eighth grade was the most interesting moment of my education.Through a love letter, I proposed to her.Harish, one of my poetic classmates, assisted me.At first, I was so afraid that I thought a lot about how to handle my letter.
%%I handed her my letter right in front of the classroom door when the second period bell rang without saying a word.The response to that letter both excited and worried me so much.She sent me a second letter at the conclusion of school.She smiled as she handed me a letter and said, "I love you."After hearing such sweet words from her, I was overjoyed.That day was the start of my adoration.That priceless experience with me at school will always be etched in my memory.
%%b. "Education gives a person power."Give examples from your own life to support this statement.
%%Answer:
%%A person is empowered by their education. Education is the most significant aspect of a person's life.It is an ongoing process that lasts a lifetime.It significantly alters our life.Human development is based on education.It is said that education is humankind's third eye.Human capital, such as doctors, engineers, pilots, and teachers, is developed through education.They might be able to contribute significantly to the country's growth.
%%A person becomes great and empowered through education.Anyone can be guided to perfection by an educated person.He or she has the ability to effect unprecedented changes in the lives of others as well.educated people mostly listened and obeyed.He or she is respected not only during their lifetime but also after their death.A person with education can change society.He or she always has a big advantage in creative projects.People who are literate and those who are illiterate differ in a number of ways.Literate individuals consistently exhibit patience when making decisions.He or she can find solutions to various life issues.We find that illiterate people lack these qualities.Education makes life more joyful, peaceful, and happy all around.

%%Word Classes (Parts of Speech)*
%%Modern grammar generally recognizes four major word classes (verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs) and five other word classes (determiners, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, interjections), totalling nine-word classes (or parts of speech). But note that some grammarians use different systems and may recognize eight or ten different word classes.

%%Preposition:*
%%Prepositions are words that usually occur in front of a noun or pronoun and express a relation to another word or element, such as: after, below, near, plus, round, from
%%Pronoun:*
%%Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns, such as I, you, his, this, that, mine, yours, who, what
%%Exclamation:*
%%Interjections have no grammatical value - words such as: ah, hey, oh, ouch, um, well

%%During this time of sudden and unprecedented disruption to education, the UNESCO-founded Global Education Coalition aims to facilitate inclusive learning opportunities for children and youth.The immediate disruption caused by COVID-19 should be mitigated by investing in remote learning, and methods should be established to develop education systems that are more open and adaptable in the future.Pledges for the security, privacy, and protection of learners' personal information are encouraged from members of the Global Coalition and prospective members.The underlined words in the text belong to various word classes or parts of speech.

%%The author of this essay has provided his readers with his suggestions for improving their writing abilities.He says that freewriting is the best way to get better at writing.To improve one's writing abilities, freewriting should be practiced frequently.He refers to this style of writing as automatic writing, in which a writer can freely express their emotions.Feedback is never accepted by Freewriting.He adds that "non-editing" is the most crucial aspect of free writing.He sees editing as the most difficult part of writing.The writer's creativity is hindered by the practice of obsessive and premature editing.During the editing process, writing becomes both difficult and dead.The author should keep freewriting separate from the editing process because doing so compromises the writer's authentic feelings and natural style.He asserts that "a voice," which includes a sound, a rhythm, and a texture, is our writing's primary source of power.Readers listen to authors because of this force.The energy drives the implications into the empty head.
%%b. According to Elbow, freewriting "is an exercise in bringing together the process of producing words and putting them on the page."Do you concur with his assertion?*Why?*Why not?*
%%Answer:
%%I concur with his assertion.Freewriting is a method of writing that happens automatically and lets the writer see his or her ideas in unexpected ways.Words are created, combined, and written on the page during this process.This procedure can be completed quickly.During the time spent freewriting, the author should compose suddenly without considering various snags language checks, spelling checks, etc.The writer needs to get away from editing.His or her free flow of ideas in their writing needs to continue.The writer can forget about worrying about editing if they practice freewriting more often.By liberating the writer's writing and breaking the ingrained habit of editing, freewriting can help overcome "writer's block."

%%The moral principles that teach us to appreciate the positive aspects of life are referred to as moral principles.A person's morals are what make them perfect.These qualities make individuals great and positive in their perspectives and ways of behaving.People are discouraged from engaging in immoral behavior in society by these values.The majority of people acquire these values from both their families and societies.Culture, religion, truthfulness, patience, obedience, honesty, integrity, hard work, responsibility, respect, tolerance, loyalty, public-spiritedness, freedom, respect for human life and dignity of persons—these are all examples of moral values.Equality, justice, and fairness are additional examples.Everyone's lives are greatly impacted by all of these factors.A person who possesses all of these characteristics is regarded as a perfect human being.People are well-nourished by these moral principles.These values have produced the majority of the world's successful individuals.We won't experience any difficulties in our lives if we adhere to these moral principles.I value responsibility the most of the aforementioned moral principles.People assume responsibility for their actions.It makes people realize their responsibilities to others.Being responsible is the only way for the majority of people to advance in life.People who try to get away from their responsibilities in life never achieve happiness or success.Therefore, living a perfect life necessitates living a responsible life.

%%        Will and Be Going To: English Grammar Lesson*
%%
%%Generally, Both "Will" and "Going to" are used to talk about the future.
%%
%%Examples:
%%
%% ▪︎ I will pay you tomorrow. (Here 'tomorrow' is in the future)
%%
%% ▪︎ I think he going to meet me later. (Here 'later' is a non-specific time in the future)
%%
%% ▪︎ They will visit me next week. ( Here 'next week' is a time in the future)
%%
%% ▪︎ We’re going to get married next year. ( Here, 'next year' is a time in the future)
%%
%%But, Here a question arises: What is the difference between "Will" and "Going to"?*
%%
%%At what time do we use "Will" or "Going to"?*
%%
%%Both terms are mainly used for making Future Predictions.
%%
%%Both terms "Will" and "Going to" can be used mostly for making predictions without having a proper difference in meaning. 
%%These terms can be used at the time when we think or expect something to happen in the future.
%%
%%Examples:
%%
%%I think it will be sunny tomorrow.
%%
%%I think it’s going to be sunny tomorrow.
%%
%%Both of these sentences are making predictions about the weather of tomorrow.
%%Here, there is no guarantee about the weather for tomorrow, we are just predicting tomorrow's weather. 
%%
%%Additional Examples:*
%%
%%I’m sure you will meet her one day.
%%
%%I’m sure you’re going to meet her one day.
So, here, both terms "Will" and "Going to" can be used for predictions that happen in the future. 
%%
%%But, there are a lot of other situations or usages where we can use one more than the other. Let’s look at these other uses of "Will" and "Going to" now.
%%
%%Usages of "Will"*
%%
%%Following are the usages of "Will" in English Grammar:*
%%We generally use "Will" in the situations below:
%%
%%For making "Instant Decisions"
%%
%%We make instant decisions about the immediate future. We more or less decide at the same time when the words are spoken.
%%
%%Examples:*
%%
%% ▪︎ I’m thirsty. I think I’ll buy a chilled Fanta. (Here, I just thought of it now)
%%
%% ▪︎ I’ll ask Simon if he knows where my notebooks are. (Here, I just decided to ask him)
%%
%% ▪︎ I think we’ll move from here right now. (Here, I just decided to move from the place this right now)
%%
%%For making "Offers"
%%
%%We can use "Will" when we are offering someone to do something for them in the future.
%%
%%Examples:*
%%
%% ▪︎ You look exhausted. I’ll cook supper tonight.
%%
%% ▪︎ I’ll drive you to the station tomorrow if you like.
%%
%% ▪︎ We’ll support you with anything you need.
%%
%% ▪︎ I’ll provide you with a discount if you buy it right now.
%%
%% ▪︎ That looks so heavy. I’ll help you if you like.
For making "Promises"
%%
%%We can make use of "Will" when we make promises to do something for someone in the future.
%%
%%Examples:*
%%
%% ▪︎ I promise I will pay you in instalments every day.
%%
%% ▪︎ I’ll come and see you the next week. 
%%
%% ▪︎ Don’t worry, we’ll make sure that nothing happens to you.
%%
%% ▪︎ I’ll buy you a new bike of 250 CC when I get paid.
For making "Threats"
%%
%%We can use "Will" when we are making a threatening statement to someone that something will happen to them in the future. 
%%
%%Examples:*
%%
%% ▪︎ If you don’t stop following me, I will tell your mother. (Here, You are threatening to tell her)
%%
%% ▪︎ You’ll pay me for this!
%%
%% ▪︎ You will get fired if you don’t finish the job this evening.
For Habits: Predictable Behaviour
%%
%%We can use "Will" for a habit that is predictable behaviour.
%%
%%Examples:*
%%
%% ▪︎ My younger daughter will fall asleep whenever we travel anywhere by bus. (Here, this is predictable, you know it is going to happen)
%%
%% ▪︎ He will give up if he starts losing the game. He always does that after losing (Here, it is a habit of his to do this)
%%

%%For making Refusals
%%
%%We can use "Won't" when someone or something refuses to do something. Someone says that they won't do something or if something doesn’t work.
%%
%%Examples:*
%%
%% ▪︎ I don’t mind what you say, I won’t do it! (Here, I refuse to do it!)
%%
%% ▪︎ They won’t help me clean my new room. (Here, no, they are not going to help)
%%
%% ▪︎ Simran won’t listen to anything I say. (Here, it is something she doesn’t want to do.)
%%
%% ▪︎ My bike won’t start. (Here, it won’t work)
 
%%Usages of "Going to"
%%
%%"Going to" is generally used to indicate the future but with some type of connection to the present. We can use it in the following situations:
%%
%%For making Prior Plans
%%
%%We can use "Going to" when we have already decided or planned to do something in the future. It is the decision that was made before the moment of speaking.

%%Examples:*
%%
%% ▪︎ We’re going to get married next year. (Here, we have planned this)
%%
%% ▪︎ I’m going to accept the job offer of Salesman. (Here, I decided this before telling you)
%%
%% ▪︎ She’s going to inform him when he arrives. (Here, that is what she has decided to do)
%%
%% ▪︎ We’re going to start a new business in the market together.  (Here, that is our plan)
For Evidence and Signs
%%
%%We can use "Going to" when there is evidence (or signs) that something is going to happen. Something is likely to happen is based on the evidence or experience that we have.
%%
%%Examples:*
%%
%% ▪︎ I think it’s going to rain – I just felt some drops on my body.
%%
%% ▪︎ I don’t feel physically well. I think I’m going to vomit.
%%
%% ▪︎ Jack hasn’t studied. He’s going to fail his exam.
For the Things "About to Happen" 
%%
%%We can use "Going to" when something is about to happen (at any moment now).

%%Examples:*
%%
%% ▪︎ Watch out! It’s going to rain on you!
%%
%% ▪︎ Run! I think it’s going to explode now.
%%
%% ▪︎ Look! Hooligans are going to attack this place.
%%
%%Comparison of "Will" vs. "Going To"
%%
%%Let’s compare "Will" and "Going to" together.
%%
%%If someone asks you:
%%
%% ▪︎ “What are you going to do today?*”
%%
%%(The questioner uses "Going to" because he/she probably assumes that you have plans)
%%
%%You can say:
%%
%% ▪︎  “I’m going to watch a movie today.”
%%
%%Here, you use "Going to" because it is a plan that you made earlier (before you were asked the question). You already know which movie you're going to watch. In this particular case, we cannot use "Will".
%%
%%But, if you haven’t made any plans for today, you could say:
%%
%% ▪︎ “I will probably meet my friends.” OR

 ▪︎ “I’m probably going to watch a movie.”

We can use either "Will" or "Going to" in our responses because we're predicting what will probably happen (since we haven’t made any plans).

%%For my situation, I put stock in carrying on with a fit life.I always try to manage my time, especially for my health, in addition to my busy schedule.The well-known adage "Health is Wealth" rings true to me.We can accomplish anything in this world if we are fit physically.Being fit does not require us to pursue happiness.We strive for happiness at every stage of our lives.I always get up early in the morning and spend my mornings doing various activities like yoga, fast walking, and light physical exercises to keep myself fit.I always walk five kilometers in the morning.I've been able to lead a healthy and intellectually active life thanks to these activities.I feel quite at ease during my workday due to my morning routine.

%%I believe in eating meals that are full of healthy ingredients.I always make an effort to stay away from unhealthy foods like fatty junk food.Even though the majority of people worldwide eat junk food because it has high satisfaction ratings and is their go-to snack, I am well aware of the risks they pose to human health.I rarely eat a lot.My food choices are very limited.I only consume nutritious foods that I believe are good for my health.

%%Any nation is only as good as its citizens.The people of a country play a crucial role in shaping its overall development.As a result, any nation's priority should be its citizens' health.The important things a nation can do to keep its citizens healthy are listed below.
%%1.Every citizen of a nation ought to have access to health insurance and benefits.
%%2.By establishing excellent hospitals in the most needy areas, a nation should provide its citizens with affordable health care.
%%3.A nation ought to pay attention to the health of its citizens.Every citizen should have their health checked for free at a specific time.

%%        The African Development Foundation, the Norwegian Agency for International Development, the Danish Voluntary Fund, and the United Nations Development Fund for Women. a. Do you think the essay's title, "Foresters Without Diplomas," is appropriate?*How?*
%%        Answer:
%%        Yes, I believe the essay's title, "Foresters Without Diplomas," is appropriate.Here we find the whole exposition rotates around the endeavors made by the ladies in Kenya to make "The Green Belt Development fruitful".
%%        The essayist and his team were the first to call foresters to show the women how they (foresters) planted trees, as described in this essay.Because they had degrees, the foresters proved to be extremely problematic.Simple tasks like planting trees and finding seeds required difficult approaches.In the end, the essayist and her team showed all of the helping women how to use common sense to do things, and they all did it very well.The women learned to identify when seeds had sprouted when they fell to the ground and were able to look for seeds in the neighborhood.There was no need for women to wait for others to plant trees.They continued to teach each other while also working on the plantation.As a result, the women are in fact foresters without degrees.The excellent work that these women do, who are given the title "foresters" but don't have degrees, has been the focus of the essay.

        C. Compose a paper on the topic "The Community Forest in Nepal."Please explain how these community forests have helped to maintain our environment's ecology.*
%%The Community Forest in Nepal The conservation and management of forests are the focus of the community forestry program.It is one of Nepal's successful participatory approaches to the discussion of forests.Communities now have authority, particularly to manage forest resources locally, thanks to this program.The people of the community use the profits and benefits from the community forests to safeguard the forests and their resources.
%%Nepal's Community Forests are in good shape.People used to cut trees at random for cultivation, settlement, and timber in the past.In the past, people used to graze their domestic animals in the jungle.The forests were in poor condition as a result of this.However, the condition of the forests has improved since they were handed over to the locals and to communities at the community level.Nepal's forests are currently well-maintained and cared for.
%%User groups have been given the ability to make decisions about forest resources within the community thanks to this approach to community forestry.The locals make a living by selling the forest's resources, which they acquire from their use.Activities for community development that have a direct impact on households with lower incomes have been enhanced and encouraged by the program.People now have jobs and even a great opportunity to earn a living wage thanks to this program.
%%In Nepal, community forestry plays a significant role in the preservation of biodiversity.The majority of trees can even be seen growing today in those barren, desolate, and abandoned lands.The prevalence of vegetation has reduced the likelihood of natural disasters like landslides and soil erosion.Biomass, carbon stock, and soil organic carbon have all significantly increased as a result of community forestry management.Wildlife habitat and water quality have been improved as a result of this strategy.We now observe an increase in the number of birds and other wild animals.
%%Nepal is a pioneer in the field of community-based forest management.This community forestry program has improved the economic situation of marginalized members of the community and made direct progress in preventing environmental degradation.Conservation and utilization of the forests ought to integrate social ties with technical aspects to make the program significantly more successful and effective.

%%Critical Thinking*
%% a. What is the most important takeaway from this essay?*Do you believe that this paper is ironical?*Why?*
%%Answer:
%%The primary objectives of this essay are to present a novel and distinct perspective on superstition and to challenge the prevalent belief that ignorant and irrational individuals are the only ones who support superstition.Superstition exists in everyone, regardless of how logical or rational they are. This is a common and natural trait, even though it is not directly indicated.The essayist makes no specific statements about the topic of the essay other than to say that it will be about superstition.
%%The author of the essay maintains that numerous superstitions are so widespread and ancient.He believes that superstition must have originated in the human mind's deepest recesses, undeterred by caste or religion.He believes that superstition is related to human interest because the human mind is curious and tries to learn about good and bad, fate or destiny, and how it affects us.
%%Indeed, I think this article is mocking.It mocks educated and literate individuals who believe in superstition despite having nothing to do with it.The author of the essay has provided numerous examples of superstition from his personal life, the university where he resides, and religious studies.The essay's irrational events have severely mocked science and modern human civilization.
%%placing jujus, lucky coins, and other fortune-bringers on candidates' desks in examination halls, avoiding walking under a ladder, resolving university issues in consultation with the I Ching, throwing salt over the left shoulder, etc.are some superstitious behaviors that even rational people believe in.
%%In addition, the author makes fun of his own superstition by revealing that he paid four shillings to touch a Lucky Baby before taking a college exam just for fun.
%%b. Can superstition be dispelled through education?*To back up your response, present your arguments.*
%%Answer:
%%Yes, superstition can be dispelled through education.It makes it easier to think and reason.Taught individuals are less inclined to be eccentric and can make others mindful of this malevolence.Ignorant individuals generally act in an unexpected way.They continue to hold on to absurd beliefs.Instead of sending sick people to the hospital, they send them to the warlock.This kind of thing rarely happens to educated people.Instead of asking a warlock to cast out demons and heal the sick, they always try to send them to the hospital.Understanding diseases, their causes, and how to treat them comes from education.
%%When someone is afraid of something or someone they don't know, superstitions take over.The superstition ceases to exist once the unidentified things become familiar.Fear will vanish from a person's mind if they discover the real truth behind a variety of meaningless things.They begin to act rationally and believe in rationality.
%%Indeed, people's perceptions of the paranormal are deeply ingrained.This is primarily due to the influence of the society in which they are raised and the cultural practices they participate in.They can be eliminated, but it's not impossible.This can only be made possible by educated people.
%% WRITING*
%% a. In about 250 words, write an essay about the superstitions that are prevalent in your community.*
%%Answer:
%%We use the term "superstition" to refer to a belief or beliefs that are not supported by scientific evidence or human reason and assert that one's actions may have a magical or mystical effect on events.Any society and its people are driven backwards by blind faith or concept.The majority of superstition-related ideas are prevalent in areas with low levels of education.These are the kinds of irrational beliefs that people have held since antiquity and continue to practice.Even though we live in what is regarded as the age of science and technology, millions of people still adhere to a variety of illogical superstitions.The majority of educated people also believe in superstitions in this day and age.
%%Our societies still have a lot of superstition.In our eastern traditional societies, the notions of superstition are prevalent.The majority of people in our societies are seen to follow absurd superstitions.Positive and negative omens are still held in high regard.People continue to seek treatment from a warlock in times of emergency or calamity.They have less faith in doctors, hospitals, and medicines.Odd notion is associated with individuals' life.When they are cutting their hair, they consider both good and bad stars.People frequently consider the days of the week to determine whether or not they should leave their homes or embark on journeys.It is regarded as unfortunate to walk beneath the ladder.When a black cat walks across their walking paths, people take it as a bad sign.There are so many concepts about superstition that cannot be changed in our societies.Since ancient times, people have been putting these ideas into practice.These illogical ideas have been passed down from one generation to the next.
%%Our societies ought to eradicate superstitions.It causes us to fall short and be destroyed.In order to eradicate this, educated and aware individuals ought to play a major role.We ought to be able to persuade the superstitious individuals who are blindly adhering to all of these beliefs.We ought to educate them concerning the marvels of Science and Innovation.
%%b. "Superstition is common in all walks of life."Prove or refute this assertion.*
%%Answer:
%%Every aspect of life is characterized by superstition.This statement completely piques my interest.We understand a blind, unproven, and unsubstantiated belief as superstition.The meaning of this term and its origins remain a mystery.This concept of "superstition" is deeply ingrained in our society, particularly in areas where the majority of people are illiterate.
%%This is the age of science and technology in the world.Despite the fact that science has dominated the entire world, many people in our societies still hold numerous superstitions.They have faith in both positive and negative omens.They have confidence in wizardry, black magic, apparitions and other unnatural things.In our culture, there is a long-standing superstition that says an empty pot on the road is not a good sign.Additionally, if a black cat crosses the road in front of us, it is regarded as unlucky.The presence of guests is indicated by a spider that is hanging.There are numerous different notions which are well established in our general public.
%%Our society cannot benefit from superstitions.Instead, it is regarded as a barrier to progress.People who are superstitious are narrow-minded.They won't listen to us, even if we tell them to stop believing in superstitions.They are unwilling to reconsider.We have heard or seen that many individuals have lost their lives because of strange notion.In some communities, rather than going to the doctor when someone gets sick, they go to witchcraft.A person who is bitten by a snake is also taken to a witch's house rather than a hospital.
%%These activities result in the victim losing his life.Even educated individuals are not immune to superstitions.We automatically feel happy whenever we see the water pitcher while traveling to other locations.We automatically feel sad whenever we come across a black cat.We automatically think of positive or negative omens.

%%COMPREHENSION*
%% a. What restrictions were placed on Black people in South Africa?*
%%Answer:
%%Black South Africans were subject to the following restrictions:
%%Political and economic discrimination; racial segregation; b. Why was Mandela arrested?*
%%Answer:
%%Organizing an armed wing of the African National Congress was the charge that led to Mandela's arrest.
%%c. How could he depict bigotry and racial persecution?*
%%Answer:
%%He said that racial discrimination and racism are the universal foundation of the harmful idea and practice.
%%d. Why did he express gratitude to all of the foreign guests?*
%%Answer:
%%He thanked all of the guests from other countries for coming to his country to join the people in their collective victory for justice, peace, and human dignity.
%%e. Why did he believe that political emancipation had been achieved in his country?*
%%Answer:
%%Because he had promised that his people would free themselves from the ongoing bonds of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender discrimination, and other forms of discrimination, he believed that the people of his country had achieved political emancipation.
%%e. What is the primary concern of Mandela's discourse?*
%%Answer:
%%The main point of Mandela's speech was that the people of South Africa should build a society where everyone will have rights, equality, justice, and peace.
%%Critical Thinking a. What does Mandela mean when he says that he wants a rainbow nation that is at peace with itself and the rest of the world?*
%%Answer:
%%When Mandela refers to South Africa as "a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world," he is referring to his country as a nation of unity with people of multi-culturalism and the coming together of people from many different nations in a country that was once recognized as having a strict division of white people from black people under the Apartheid regime.
%%The nation of South Africa is allegorically called the "Rainbow Country" by Nelson Mandela.Like in a rainbow, there are seven distinct colors.In contrast to earlier divisions based on skin color, the term "rainbow nation" is used to describe the unity of various cultural, racial, and ethnic groups in the country following apartheid.
%%The rainbow is a symbol of optimism and a bright future in some South African cultures.Mandela envisioned a tranquil setting in which he could establish a society in which all South Africans, black and white, would have the full right to human dignity and could live without fear.Like the colors in a rainbow, he wanted them to work together and stick together.He wished that they could live together and forget their violent and oppressive past.
%%b. Those who held him for such a long time deserved retribution from Mandela.He took the road to reconciliation instead.Why do you believe he did that?*
%%Answer:
%%Mandela was a popular and visionary leader of South Africa who was committed to fostering harmony and peace.He adhered to non-violent philosophy.During his time as president, Mandela led his people and country with great wisdom.He primarily advocated for reconciliation and met the expectations of all of his supporters worldwide.Even during critical times, he was able to successfully steer a nation and his people toward a negotiated settlement.He validated the concept of national reconciliation, which he not only essentially advocated for but also carried out with confidence when communicating with former adversaries.He spent so much time in jail.However, he has never sought vengeance against the people in South Africa who captured him, tortured his people, and committed terrible atrocities against black people.
%%Mandela was so kind and believed that people should forgive others.He was willing to be forgiven.He was of the opinion that rivalry, retaliation, and animosity only serve to foster destructive outcomes.According to him, such emotions frequently cause discord and polarization among individuals, preventing harmony among them.He saw national reconciliation as a fundamental act of his presidency, overseeing the transition from racial minority rule to a multicultural democracy.
%%Mandela reassured the white population of South Africa that they were protected and represented in the country after examining other colonial African economies that had been weakened by the departure of the white elite.He primarily emphasized the significance of people's unity to his people.They believed that unity was required for prosperity.His primary objective was to liberate all of his people from the shackles of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender discrimination, and other forms of discrimination.
%%c. Why and how have societies around the world struggled with segregation?*In your community, do you observe any signs of segregation?*Discuss.
%%Answer:
%%The division of people into racial or other categories (such as religion or sex) geographically, at home, in businesses, on public transportation, etc. is referred to as "segregation."To put it another way, it is the social segregation of people based on their race, ethnicity, or nationality, among other things.It is referred to as an inequality condition.The majority of societies around the world struggled with this issue.One of the most prevalent forms of segregation in the past was racial segregation.Even though it is generally against the law now, social norms continue to make it common in various parts of the world even when no one has a strong preference for it.The idea of racial isolation has showed up in all regions of the planet where there are multiracial networks.
%%The majority of societies practice segregation.The idea of segregation can be done by accident or by choice.Separation between people only makes things worse in the future.People can experience social, economic, and political tensions as a result of any form of isolation.Disorder can arise when individuals are treated unfairly.They avoid the mainstream of society by treating minorities as inferior beings.Minorities are always oppressed and denied civil and political rights by the idea of segregation.Fundamental integration and equality are frequently hampered by this practice of segregation.This kind of behavior is something that happens all the time, like rejecting equal opportunities that affect people's living conditions.Women, members of ethnic groups, homosexuals, and members of mixed religious groups have all reported being subjected to persecution throughout history.
%%Nepal does not have any laws that support segregation.This idea is thought to be against the law in this place.Any society that is religious, caste, or ethnically segregated is not supported by the judiciary.However, due to its inherent existence in societies, it is reported in a variety of locations.Yes, my society displays various forms of segregation.Different situations of segregation exist.People have prejudices based on caste, religion, and race.Caste, religion, and ethnicity are still used to classify people in our society.People continue to be treated the same as members of minority groups.Minority groups are prohibited from touching water, marrying, entering temples, and other activities in various locations.People's so-called egos cause division.
%%a. Nepal's political history is a mess of contradictions.At various times, numerous shifts have been observed.Write a brief biography of any Nepali freedom fighter that takes into account the changes they brought about.
%%Answer:
%%The Avengers:One of the most well-known figures in the political history of Nepal is Ganesh Man Singh.He is considered Nepal's respected democratic leader.He is also called "An Iron Man" to us.He is still regarded as Nepal's supreme leader by all Nepalese for his outstanding contributions.
%%Ganesh Man Singh was born on November 9, 1915, into a wealthy family in Itumbahal, Kathmandu.After his father passed away, he was raised by his grandfather.
%%He attended Durbar High School through sixth grade.He was kicked out of the school because he didn't treat his Rana classmates with respect.He went on to study in India later.
%%He planned to protest against Nepal's autocratic rulers when he returned to Nepal after completing his I.S. from India.He joined Praja Parishad, Nepal's first political party, in 1940.
%%He was later arrested when he was 18 years old.For his anti-Rana activities, he was even given a life sentence. However, in 1944, he got out of Bhadragol prison and went to India.
%%In 1949, he joined the Nepali Congress as one of its founding members.In 1958, he became a minister in the cabinet.
%%He was detained for eight years in the Sundrijal military detention camp following the coup led by the late King Mahendra.He didn't let his spirits get the better of him.He advocated for Nepali democracy after his release.In 1990, he was in charge of the democratic movement in Nepal that overthrew the panchayat system.He was never interested in party politics.
%%In 1990, he received the Peace Run Award from the United States.He was also the first Asian person to receive the UN Human Rights Award.He died tragically on September 18, 1997.In Nepal, he was the first commoner to have a state funeral.

Answer the following questions:*
%%
%%a. Why didn't the mother recognise her son Gopi?*
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%The mother didn't recognize her son Gopi because of her old age's absent-mindedness. She was eighty-three years old and she lost her memory sometimes.

%%b. Why is the sister living with her mother?*
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%The sister is living with her mother to care for her mother. She is a widow and there is no one at home to care for her mother except her.

%%c. What is the sister's attitude towards her brother?*
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%The sister's attitude towards her brother isn't good at all. She is critical of her brother's behaviour.

%%d. Does the son love his mother very much?* How do you know that?*
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%No, the son doesn't love his mother very much. I know that after reading this story. The son lives away from his mother along with his wife and four children. He doesn't even remember to write to his mother. He has arrived in his village for his property's share but not for his mother's love.

%%e. What does the mother actually need: a blanket or the warmth of her son's love?*
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%The mother actually needs the warmth of her son's love. She has lacked her son's love in her life. 

%%f. What does the phrase 'the tattered blanket' mean?* Is it only the blanket that is tattered?*
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%The phrase 'the tattered blanket' means torn or ragged blanket. No, it isn't only the blanket that is tattered. Here, we find the tattered relationship in the story. The tattered blanket symbolizes the forgotten relationship of a son. The relationship between son and mother is tattered here due the son's critical behaviour.

%%g. The son says, 'Amma can't remember who I am'. Do you think that he remembered his mother?* Why didn't he answer when his sister asked, 'Do you remember your Amma?*'
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%No, I don't think he remembered his mother. He didn't answer his sister's question because he hadn't met his Amma for five years and written a letter to her for a year. 

%%CRITICAL THINKING *
%%
%%a. What can be the expectations of the parents from their offspring at the old age?*
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%In old age, people become weak both physically and mentally. The aged people have to face varieties of problems. The old parents in most of the places don't seem happy. They only complain most of the time. They find things quite opposite and against their interests. Due to the lack of understanding, they are mostly seen as upset with their children. A lack of misunderstanding between parents and children is seen. The aged parents feel a lack of proper care and love. Their children even don't understand the real need of their parents. The old, as well as aged parents, expect much from their children but the children seem as if they are doing their best for their parents. The only thing which creates a lot of problems is the lack of understanding between them. At old age, our parents have some expectations and all of us need to fulfil their expectations and make them happy.

%%There are various basic things that old parents require. They basically expect love, affection and care from their children. They long for money, healthy food, suitable clothes, a comfortable bed and regular health check-ups etc. The most important things that they require are talking and understanding. They want their children to listen to and talk to them. Here in this condition of old age, their children should try their best to provide their parents with the time, support, talk and care. Old people are emotionally very weak. They have to live their lives only in the glory of their pasts. The children should pay proper attention to their parents, meet their pace and support them emotionally in their needs. 

%%Most elderly parents always try to show their children the righteous paths. They want their children to pay attention to their advice as well as suggestions. They try to share their knowledge regarding good life and career. All children need to listen to their aged parents.
%%

%%In this world, most children try to neglect the right advice of their old parents. They suppose themselves great and logical. All the children must permit their parents to be a part of their lives and welcome their valuable advice to have a successful life ahead. The expectations of our aged parents are so limited. They only want our happiness the most. Their requirements in their old age are so limited. It is not so hard to fulfil their requirements. Their needs can easily be fulfilled. Thus, we should try to keep them happy by respecting their advice and giving them time.
b. Some children who live in a distance tend to be indifferent to the feelings of their parents. Why do you think they are like that?* Discuss. 
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%A relationship is a kind of connection that plays a very vital role in everyone's life. The young age of children is considered to be the age of knowing and understanding others. During this period, children mostly learn their connections with others. They learn various things quickly and make their bonding easily. This is the age where they start learning about their kingship. Here in this stage, children get emotionally connected with their family members. If there is a gap between them and their parents, they tend to be indifferent to the feelings of their parents. 

%%It is a bitter truth that the more you spend your time with someone, the more you get closer to them. In the case of children and parents, the same things happen. There should be a close relationship between parents and children. In most cases, it is seen that the gap between parents and children has created a lack of understanding between them. Among children and parents, none seem to understand each other's feelings. It is a gap that makes them indifferent toward each other.

%%
%%Children have to spend their time away from their parents in their lifetime. They can't be with their parents for entire their life. They have to be away for various reasons. Everyone has to think about their careers. When they struggle for their achievements in different sectors living away from their parents, they become goals oriented and less think about their kingship. There comes a gap or distance between parents and children. I think children are like that because living their life away from their parents, they lack suggestions or advice, love and care, closeness etc of their parents. They become one-sided and think about themselves. They don't want to share their problems with their parents. They try to tackle their problems themselves. Thus, they tend to be indifferent to the feelings of their parents.

%%c. A mother's love is everlasting and indispensable. Justify. 
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%The term mother is so auspicious and above all the relationships. This term cannot be compared with anything in the world. Mother is a precious gift from God to us. The relationship with mother has made love and affection possible in this world. Mothers in this world are the symbol of love, tolerance, patience and forgiveness. We can't apply any condition to the love of a mother. Mother's love is priceless and above all. The affection of the mother remains till the end. We can easily say that mother's love is unconditional, everlasting and indispensable.

%%In most situations, a child finds his mother as a best friend, teacher and caretaker. A mother is too devoted to her child. She keeps on doing her best for the sake of her child. She plays with the child along with extra care and nourishment. She never feels tired of fulfilling all his demands. She does her care work all the time without thinking a bit about her problems. Mothers' love is about both nourishing and teaching their children moral and cultural values. A mother gives her full service entire her lifetime, especially in the matter of her child.



%%In any family, mothers are considered the emotional foundation of love and affection. They are the real persons who take overall responsibility for others. They support and respect everyone's feelings in a family. A mother in the family always provides support to her family members. She is the one with whom family members can easily share their feelings. Mothers mainly have a huge level of faith in their families. Furthermore, mothers possess an exceptionally forgiving nature.
%%

%%Thus, a mother's love for her child undoubtedly cannot be compared with anything else in the world. She is the most essential person in everyone's life.

%%A. Our country is put on lockdown for nearly three months due to COVID-19 pandemic. Following is an example of a diary entry about the feelings and experiences of a person who is locked up at home.

%%Saturday, March 28, 2020.
%%
%%Today is the 5th day that we have been put on lockdown. Almost all the countries in the world are forced on to implement this system. And, my country is not an exception too. 

%%It is called the travellers’ disease which transmits from one person to another through physical contact. WHO has advised people to maintain physical distance, use masks and sanitizer. Washing hands with soap very carefully is a common phenomenon. No vehicles are in operation in the street and shops are closed. People are locked up in their own homes like caged animals in the zoo. What a situation that has enforced us to be locked up in our own home!

%%A very microorganism is threatening the human existence. Are human beings enemies to nature so that we are facing such a threat?* Maybe we have done irreparable damage to nature in the name of development. We have encroached upon nature and destroyed the habitats of other living beings. Developed countries are in a race to test nuclear weapons and missiles to demonstrate their power and pelf. Now where’s their power gone?* Why cannot they get victory over corona virus?* What’s the use of their so-called devastating weapons?* Now it seems that corona virus is taking the side of creatures to challenge the so-called superpower of the cosmos. This microorganism is affecting human lives very badly irrespective of class, caste, religion, race, geography and ideology.

%%Now I could imagine how caged birds and animals feel when they are behind the bar. We are in the cage! I am feeling as if I am locked up in the human zoo. Perhaps it is the demand of time to teach humans a serious lesson about their existence. I can feel how badly people might be suffering due to lock down. The world has stood still due to corona virus. The worst thing about this situation is that there is no vaccine or any medicine made for the cure of this pandemic virus. Just staying at home and maintaining physical distance is the only solution to COVID-19. I hope we will soon be free from this pandemic. Let’s stay at home safe and sound!

%%B. Suppose a child who lived in a city with his/her parents accompanied his/her father to visit an elderly grandmother in the village. The grandmother was waiting for her son to come back to the village and look after her, but her son was not willing to do so. Write a diary on behalf of the elderly grandmother describing her feeling of not living with her children and grandchildren.
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%January, 12, 2021
%%
%%In this entire world, I love my children and my grandchildren much. My love and affection for them are so deep. At the age of 80 years, I always wishes for the wellbeing of my children only. I keep on waiting for their arrival in my village. My eyes always keep on waiting for them most of the time. Today, At this age I feel quite lonely. I'm spending my miserable days and nights in their memories.

%%People often seek companionship in their loneliness. I want to have the company of my children and grandchildren. I want to spend my time with my children. I want to talk to them. I'm a bit confused. After their last visit, why didn't they come here to meet me?* Did I do something wrong with them?* But as far as I know, I didn't do any bad things to them. My son Hari seemed quite upset the last time. I'm in a dilemma whether my son Hari and his children will come or not. I'm missing them a lot.
%%


%%The last time when I went to stay with them in the city, I really felt difficult to pass my time. I spent my 2 weeks alone in 6 rooms flat. They are quite busy and mostly care about their timetable. I had very bad experiences living over there. I got very little time to spend with my grandchildren. I only got a few minutes to talk to my son Hari. I don't prefer city life. I cannot tolerate the dust and noise pollution. Later, my son and grandchildren visited our village for a week. I advised my son Hari varieties of things regarding his lifestyle in the city. Perhaps he felt upset to hear my words.

%%Due to my old age, I get angry in no time. I can't remember things much. The feeling of loneliness is quite sad. My overall expectations depend on them. Most time, I only hope to see them with me. I hope that I will see my son and grandchildren sooner

%%iv.Critical Thinking a. Do you agree with Machiavelli's view that a good leader can do bad and dishonest things to keep his power and protect his government?* Printed materials, reading, and learningExplain.
%%Answer:
%%Yes, I concur with Machiavelli's perspective.He says that a good leader can be dishonest and do bad things to keep his power and protect his government.We have heard about a variety of examples of good leadership and even bad governance in this world.Even a good leader can change his mind and decide to misuse his authority in the wrong way for the benefit of his position.After gaining political power and wealth, most leaders become evil.Those leaders engage in dishonest actions against the populace.They begin to regard their position and their government as significantly more significant than anything else.
%%People don't want to lose their authority or position.He finds himself relying increasingly on the security of his position.A leader disregards established guidelines when he engages in dishonest behavior.He actively participates in breaking the rules.He only believes in hooking and crooking his way into position.His governance demonstrates the overall effect.He has no concern for the problems of others.His primary concern during a crisis is the safety of his position.He keeps making mistakes over and over again to get it.
%%Those pioneers whose fundamental objective is restricted in looking for influence, abundance and popularity, just contemplate themselves.They attempt to defy their moral standards and forget their responsibilities as a result of this pursuit.The majority of world leaders have achieved this level of prominence in their lives by endangering the lives of others.They begin committing wrongdoing because they are afraid of losing their position at the top.
%%The real reason for choosing leadership should be questioned by everyone.They should abstain from this desire if their response is to misuse power because the final results of their leadership are so risky and destructive.In the end, they have to deal with disasters.
%%b. Do you consider literature and art to be significant national assets?*Be specific.
%%Answer:
%%Yes, I believe that literature and art are important assets for a nation.Literature and art are both extremely important to any nation.Because they contain social, cultural, and economic values, they are so valuable to any nation.Literature and art convey the nation's identity as well as the identities of its citizens.
%%The nation's citizens benefit from the wealth of information that literature and art provide about its history.Literature aids in the management of various aspects of life, whereas art teaches people a way of life.Literature and art always aid the nation's citizens in their struggle for a better and more prosperous life.They make people more sensitive to the sufferings of the people and make them feel more strongly against oppression and injustice.
%%Workmanship and writing decide the general parts of a country.They carry the cultural and social values that make it possible for people to interact with one another and effect social change.Literature and art both advance simultaneously in every facet of life.These are the real assets that guide people's lives in a morally upright direction.
%% WRITING*
%% a. Compose an essay titled "Literature is the reflection of society."*
%%Answer:
%%The expression "Literature is the reflection of society" is well-known. Literature is the reflection of society.Literature is also referred to as the "mirror of society."Literature truly conveys society's good and bad values.Literature aims to correct society's wrongs by illuminating its flaws and encouraging people to learn from them.Additionally, it exemplifies the society's virtues and morals for people to follow.Literature imitates human behavior.It frequently portrays societal attitudes, words, and deeds.Stories in literature are told by characters who, through their words, deeds, and reactions, convey certain educational, informational, and entertaining messages about human life and action.Because no writer is fully exposed to the world around him, it is impossible to find a piece of literature that ignores the attitudes, morals, and values of society.Writers of literature transform real-life events in their society into fictional narratives to serve as a mirror through which individuals can examine their own shortcomings and seek redress when necessary.As a result, literature not only reflects society but also serves as a mirror of self-correction, allowing society members to recognize the need for positive change.To comprehend how literature actually reflects society, it is necessary to examine some works of literature more closely.
%%b. It is said that today’s reader is tomorrow’s leader. Do you agree with this statement?* Explain. 
%%Answer:
%%
%%Yes, I agree with this statement that today's reader is tomorrow's leader. There is no doubt here in this statement. As we know, reading is one of the essential sources that develop our intellectual standards. It is an art that improves our skills and provides us with broad knowledge of various aspects. 

%%The fluency of one's language is determined by the quality of reading.  In addition, vocabulary enrichment, idea collection, familiarity with a variety of writing formats, fluency of speech, etc., all depend on reading.
%%
%%

%%A reader always finds something important to engage himself/herself. His/her reading habit never let him alone or bored. Books provide him/her with immense of those things which are helpful to understand the world. He/She finds himself/herself at a higher level of his/her life.

%%Books make people wise and active. Through books, people learn every aspect of life. Their minds grasp all those things which lead them to a higher position. Reading books helps to reach a perfect goal.

%%
%%Books are the source of knowledge. Thus, if we want to be a leader in the coming future, we have to spend time reading books on different topics. This habit of the present time will surely lead us to a higher position one day.

%%Critical Thinking*
%% a. The genre of writing known as "Down the rabbit hole" is called fantasy.Based on your reading of the story, what distinguishes this type of writing in particular?*
%%Answer:
%%When we talk about fantasy in literature, we mean the type of writing that typically deals with themes of magic and the supernatural, as well as imaginary worlds and creatures.Fiction is dealt with in fantasy.Characters and events that couldn't happen in real life are included in fiction.Dream is a thought that is no premise in all actuality.It is a great distance from the real world.Most fictional works focus on characters, places, and events that never happened.These kinds of characters, happenings, and worlds are mostly found in novels, movies, and television shows.Examples include Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, and Frankenstein.
%%The majority of fantasy works contain elements of magic and the supernatural.These manifestations utilize these components as the primary plot, subject and setting.These creations primarily depict a conflict between good and evil, the seasons, the life cycle—birth, growth, and death, among other things.
%%Most of the time, we meet characters from outlandish places in a fantasy.The characters in dream are frequently astounding with various amazing demonstrations.We encounter demons, ghosts, witches, fairies, princes, princesses, kings and queens, knights, dragons, talking animals, angels and devils, elves, cyclops, and unicorns, among other things, in the majority of fantasy works.as significant figures.The experiences these characters offer to their audience are thrilling.The majority of fantasy works are set in a wizarding kingdom, magical forest, medieval fantasy world, heaven, or a wizarding land after death.The major themes of honor, loyalty, finding a mysterious object, completing a quest, sacrificing something, and so on drive the majority of fantasy authors' creations.
%%b. Is it beneficial to imagine things that cannot be accomplished in reality?*Explain.
%%Answer:
%%Yes, it is beneficial to imagine things that cannot be accomplished in reality.The first step, in my opinion, for everyone is to imagine how things will work out.At first, everyone must imagine.The first step toward eventual success is imagination.
%%The majority of people around the world hold the belief that imagination is bad and far from reality.But people achieve their goals through imagination.Without creativity, a man is useless.In the life of such a person, there is no progress.People who lack creative ability find and consider everything in this world to be impractical.Life never changes for them, and the results are wonderful.However, for imaginative individuals, imagination is the only means of realizing dreams.The first step in shaping our hopes, actions, and behaviors is imagination.
%%I believe that creativity is one of the most crucial factors in success.People can use it to design their successful futures, and it is a very useful tool.Daydreaming, wishing, and illusion are all related to imagination, which is a mental activity.The imagination is the starting point for any person's ambition, goal, plan, etc.The imagination becomes a reality through persistent effort over time.In this world, nothing is impossible.There is a requirement for endeavors.People believed that many of the world's scientists were insane.However, they made improbable outcomes a reality.Because of their tireless efforts, their imagination came to life.They got through various affronts from individuals yet continued to really buckle down on their creative mind.
%%The fact that a successful person initially creates a mental image of his goal and makes it real in very appropriate steps has been demonstrated by numerous facts all over the world.
%%The most crucial thing is for him to be very open about his imagination.He has the potential to succeed due to his determination.The task is not simple, but it is not impossible.If their visions are accurate, imaginative people can perform at their best.We can even accomplish things that seem impossible in our world if we keep trying our hardest and taking the necessary actions.
%%c. When you're having trouble, do you talk to yourself?*If so, in what ways does it aid you?*
%%Answer:
%%Yes, when I'm having trouble, I talk to myself.It assists me in numerous ways.When I'm too confused about where my things are exactly, this habit of talking helps me.I start talking to myself while I search when I can't find important things.I can easily locate my belongings thanks to this habit.Next, when I'm in trouble, this routine helps me decide right away whether I want to get rid of it or find a solution.When things are going badly, this habit really helps.My propensity to talk has saved me numerous times.In a similar vein, when you are in extremely anxious circumstances, this habit gives you additional options for getting rid of problems.Our minds are kept active and sharp by this habit.The majority of the time, one is motivated by this habit.It helps us focus on the most significant aspects of our lives.We keep putting our attention on the things that need to be done.As a result, this routine helps us feel more secure and keeps our minds sharp.

%%b. Tell me about a strange dream you had recently.
%%Answer:
%%A Bad dream
%%
%%The previous evening I envisioned a horrible dream about obscure individuals.In fact, I slept late last night.I went to sleep at 3 a.m. after I watched my movie.I saw myself at a party with my friends after I slept.In a hall that was partially dark, I saw all of my friends.In tune with hip-hop songs, they were dancing.I turned out to be so glad to see them and moved towards them.I began to notice that my friends were unknown individuals with hideous faces as I got closer to them.They all had terrible weapons in their possession.They were furious when they saw me and kept chasing me to chop down.I made my way out of that area and toward the thick forest.Because they were searching for me with torchlights all over the forest, I was also terrified.While I was hiding in the bushes, I yelled loudly to see a black snake that was right next to me.I was surrounded on all sides by them.I cried hard and woke up in my room when they tried to cut me up with their knives.Actually, I don't know what this dream means, but there is a psychological reason for it."Wrong turn" was the cannibal movie I saw last night.A horrible group of people used to chop people up and eat the meat.While watching that film I was frightened to the point that is the reason exactly the same thing comes to my fantasy

%%a. When Mahabir Pun returned to Nepal from the United States, how did he begin his lifelong journey in Nepal?*
%%Answer:
%%Mahabir Pun began his lifelong journey in Nepal after returning from the United States. He planned to stay in his rural village of Nangi in the Myagdi district and provide assistance to the villagers through volunteer teaching in the village's high school.
%%b. Why did he not want to work for a company in Nepal or the United States?*
%%Answer:
%%He didn't want to work for other companies in Nepal or the United States because he wanted to work for himself and do something for the benefit of Nepali people outside of the idea of a "better life."
%%c. Why participated he in innovation?*
%%Answer:
%%He innovated in order to come up with a variety of community-related solutions.In addition, the idea of national economic development inspired him to participate in innovation.
%%d. Which programs generate income and were started with his assistance?*
%%Answer:
%%The pay creating programs that he assisted with beginning are as per the following:
%%Papermaking, cheesemaking, jammaking, yak farming, camping for trekkers, beekeeping, vegetable farming, handicraft making, fish farming, and other similar activities
%%e. Who is supporting Pun as he continues his campaign?*
%%Answer:
%%To continue his campaign, Pun is gaining community and individual support.
%%f. How did developed nations achieve prosperity?*
%%Answer:
%%The developed nations have always prioritized research and innovation for their economic development, which has resulted in their prosperity.They generally attempt to put more in these two areas since they realize that these areas are motors to drive monetary turn of events.
%%g. How can we keep Nepal's most creative and talented people there?*
%%Answer:
%%By providing them with well-equipped platforms, a pleasant working environment, and a comprehensive support system, we can keep the most creative and talented people in Nepal.
%%Critical Thinking*
%% a. Pun asserts, "We do not have a culture of innovation that encourages young people to be creative and innovative."Do you concur with him?*Explain.
%%Answer:
%%Yes, I wholeheartedly concur with Mahabir Pun's assertion.When we talk about innovation, we're referring to the addition of something novel to rituals, practices, etc.One of the main drivers of economic expansion is innovation.The majority of developed nations have prioritized innovation and innovative workforce.These developed nations are at the top thanks to a variety of novel concepts and inventions.Without prioritizing research and innovation and investing a significant amount of money to promote its innovative workforce, no nation has ever achieved financial success.
%%Teachers, students, and the young people of Nepal really don't have a culture of innovation.
%%Innovative ideas are just as important as the students' academic grades.However, neither research nor novel concepts are given priority in our schools, colleges, or even universities.Nobody wishes to discuss innovations.The same old methods are still used in our education system and its policies.The education system only requires students to read books, memorize information, and write exams.Our educational system has remained unchanged since ancient times.Even innovation is not something our government is interested in.Encouragement of young people to be creative and innovative is not helpful.Every year, a lot of students prefer to travel abroad in search of better education due to the lack of high-quality options.
%%Whether in developed nations or abroad, research-based topics receive top priority.The government even puts a significant amount of money into this kind of education.Learning about the various modern gadgets' inventions is difficult for the students.However, there are still no opportunities for young people in Nepal who want to try something new.We don't have a culture that encourages them here.The talented young people don't want to stay in Nepal and work there because of this.
%%To keep the most creative and talented people in Nepal and use them for the country's economic development, I believe it is the government's responsibility to create a supportive environment.
%%b. What qualities are necessary for becoming an entrepreneur?*
%%Answer:
%%Entrepreneurs can have a wide range of personalities and come from a variety of backgrounds, but they also possess innovative business opportunities and the desire to effect change.So, what makes a great founder of a startup?*Find out what essential qualities and skills are required to succeed as an entrepreneur.
%%1.Leadership:
%%The ability to lead is one of an entrepreneur's most important skills.An entrepreneur is capable of leading other people.He or she must be adept at managing the staff and all major decisions for everyone.
%%2.Vision:
%%The next important quality of an entrepreneur is vision.True trailblazers in the business world always have a plan in mind.He or she must have numerous business-related concepts.
%%3.Motivation:
%%Motivation is the third important quality of an entrepreneur.The best business visionary is interminably determined.He or she has a gift for inspiring others to do more, work harder, and perform better almost every day.
%%4.Positivity:
%%Positivity is another important quality for an entrepreneur.The most successful businessperson is aware of the fine line that must be crossed in order to maintain optimism.In the end, being positive is much more than just being happy or constantly affirming others.
%%5.Risk-inclined:
%%The willingness to take risks is the next essential trait of an entrepreneur.Even the most effective startup will encounter numerous challenges along the way, and simply establishing a company is rarely an easy process.Every business faces its fair share of risks, whether it's overcoming a challenging learning curve, accomplishing a lofty fundraising objective, or meeting an impossible deadline.He or she must be willing to take those risks as an entrepreneur, but they should not be taken lightly.
%%6.Creativity:
%%The next important quality of an entrepreneur is creativity.Because an entrepreneur is able to see better ways of making products, running a business, and living life, they rarely follow the rules.
%%7.Adaptability:
%%Adaptability is the next essential quality for an entrepreneur.Flexibility and creativity go hand in hand.While an entrepreneur's vision might not be appealing to every member of his or her target audience, being adaptable might make it possible for him or her to make important product updates that make the launch a success.
%%8.Tenacity:
%%Another important trait of an entrepreneur is tenacity.There is a lot more to building a business than just focus and drive.One should be persistent as an entrepreneur, constantly redefining their goals and staying on track to achieve them.

%%h. How did Napoleon manage to become an even more formidable ruler?*
%%Answer:
%%If he had not been driven by his love of power, Napoleon could have been an even greater ruler.He was doomed due to his passion for power.
%%Critical Thinking a. What are some of the characteristics of a great leader?*How long can a great leader stay in power in a country?*Discuss.
%%Answer:
%%Leaders are those with the power to direct or lead all aspects of governance.They are the true heroes who bring nations and people to prosperity.They are a nation's foundation.They are the ones who have complete control over shaping, planning, and carrying out development and other activities.Their contributions may result in unprecedented advancements for communities, institutions, and nations.
%%No, a great leader cannot maintain power for an extended period of time.This assertion is supported by numerous arguments.A leader also makes mistakes because they are human.He or she also makes mistakes over time.A leader need not always follow through with the right decisions.Sometimes, he or she makes bad decisions that the country's people have to deal with.The nation's citizens begin to criticize the leader for his or her mistakes after the leader makes bad decisions.A personal treat is all that greatness is.This is temporary.It is fleeting as it were.
%%We can look at Napoleon Bonaparte's life as an example.He was a great leader for a long time, but the one mistake he made when he invaded Russia made him a common person.If he hadn't been motivated by his love of power, Napoleon would have even been able to rule for a long time as a great ruler.The following are some of the qualities that can make a great leader:
%%Integrity, vision, the capacity to delegate, inspiration, communication, responsibility, self-awareness, gratitude, learning agility, influence, empathy, courage, and respect are all aspects of democracy. b. Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth president of the United States, defined democracy as "government of the people for the people and by the people."Do you believe that it is perfectly applicable to Nepal right now?*Explain.
%%Answer:
%%The greatest leader and 16th president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, once stated that democracy is the government of the people, for the people, and by the people.He was absolutely correct in his statement.I don't think it fits perfectly in the current Nepali setting.Nepal's democracy is still in its infancy.It is being practiced by Nepali leaders and citizens alike.We are all aware that Nepal is a democratic federal republic.Democracy is very important and useful for everyone.It is an important political movement for developing nations like Nepal.
%%The nation's citizens are given higher priority in democratic systems.They are given a variety of chances.Democracy has numerous advantages.In a democracy, differences of opinion and disagreements can always be resolved peacefully.Democracy fosters respect for human dignity.As long as it does not restrict others' ability to act, speak, and think freely, people enjoy this freedom.Before the law, every citizen is equal.We track down a no problem at all local area.The government is excellent; it is effective, open, responsive, and accountable to citizens.Representatives elected by the people can be held accountable.
%%Nepal has a democratic form of government.The lives and expectations of the Nepali people are evolving as a result of this governance system.People in this nation are exercising their various rights.They are going through a wide range of brand-new experiences in their lives.With regards to Nepal, individuals are getting the products of these freedoms at an extremely sluggish speed.Diverse new skills are still being acquired by people.Right now, conditions are improving.Nepal's democracy faces a number of difficulties in addition to these brand-new developments.
%%The proper operation of governmental institutions and constitutional organs is essential to the upholding of democratic norms and values.However, a particular group has rendered them powerless.Corruption can be found everywhere.Bribery appears to be very widespread among people.People are being directed in the wrong directions by political leaders.Up until now, the people of Nepal have never had a government that was accountable and responsible.In government institutions, the notions of favoritism and nepotism exist.
%%In Nepal, there are numerous things that must fundamentally change.The democratic system and its future will have disastrous outcomes if these factors are ignored.
%%Writing a 500-word essay on power and politics*
%%Answer:
%%Essay on Politics and Power The meaning of the word "power" varies depending on the setting.The capacity to coerce, influence, or exert control is the social definition of power.In a similar vein, economic power is defined as a person, group, or nation's capacity to improve its financial situation.From a political point of view, power can be defined as the capacity of politicians, leaders, and others to influence government policy and, as a result, control decisions made by individuals and nations.In every nation on the planet, political power is exercised through a variety of power dynamics among political parties, social classes, and ethnic groups.
%%The capacity of an individual to exert influence over others is the definition of "power."It has the power to influence a variety of behaviors, beliefs, and actions.of humans.It is a process by which individuals and political parties form connections.
%%On the other hand, the term "politics" refers to the procedures and activities involved in running a government, organization, or movement.It is viewed as the primary course of affecting the different boundaries of force.The legitimate system of influence is undermined by the actions of self-serving individuals.
%%For any organization to function properly, power and politics are required.With the legitimate dissemination of force, any association works without a hitch.In every sector, power and politics must be in perfect balance.We observe political pressures and power struggles in every sector.These aspects are still being used by people to their advantage.When people misuse their power and get involved in politics, they sometimes suffer huge losses.Any of these aspects must be applied in accordance with established guidelines.This mixed approach may occasionally result in unexpected outcomes for everyone.The circumstances might change in the opposite direction, and there might be a fight between people.A perfect decision should result from putting these crucial aspects into practice.The results of rash choices can be disastrous.
%%Since ancient times, people have been familiar with both the idea of politics and how to behave in a political setting.This idea can't be ignored by anyone.Whether they are aware of it or not, everyone is involved in politics.Politics is regarded as an essential component of human existence.Politics has significantly shaped this world.Everyone is rushing around in this world to ensure their own survival.Money and work are now absolutely necessary for everyone.In the majority of workplaces, individuals compete for status advancement.The idea of politics is always entwined in situations where people compete with one another or make a variety of demands. We also find a variety of political pressing issues and power struggles practically.Politics and the use of power ought to be governed in a manner that is appropriate.If these rules are unclear, people will react badly to the situation.
%%Therefore, in every industry, both aspects are essential.The way it is put to use is the most important thing.Politics and power ought to serve the interests of humanity as a whole.It should not be used with disastrous results.

COMPREHENSION *
%%Provide responses to the following inquiries:*
%%a. Why was Mergari, an Italian socialist, treated like a crazy person?*
%%Answer:
%%Because Mergari, an Italian socialist, had spoken a few human words in the Italian chamber, he was treated like a madman.
%%b. Is it possible to achieve political goals through the illegal use of war?*How, if so?*
%%Answer:
%%Indeed, political points can be accomplished by the criminal instrumentality of war.Political leaders are skilled speakers.By using powerful language, they are able to easily divert people's attention.People's minds are easily swayed toward nationalism by them.They make supporters blind by brainwashing their minds, preparing them to die for the country.
%%c. Which plans and hopes were said to be at odds with one another?*
%%Answer:
%%It is said that France's plans to attack Germany and Germany's hopes for peace negotiations in Brest Litovsk contradict each other.
%%d. What ought to be every man of good will on earth's sacred duty?*
%%Answer:
%%Not to shroud ourselves in indifference and allow events to unfold as they do, but to do everything in our power to avert the ultimate disaster, ought to be the sacred duty of every man of good will on this planet.
%%e. Is it beneficial to implicitly accept war as a political tool?*What else should be done if not?*
%%Answer:
%%No, tacitly accepting war as a political tool is not a good idea.We must provide sufficient reasons for peace rather than war.Few people wish for war.Those who support the idea of war must see our content and hatred.
%%f. How can we put an end to global war?*
%%Answer:
%%If we really want to, we can put an end to the world war.For a brief period of time, we ought to concentrate solely on removing obstacles and barriers to peace.We must be serious and determined to accomplish this.
%%g. What is the essay's main point?*
%%Answer:
%%This essay's main point is that peace is essential to humanity's well-being and inevitable.Humanity can make serious efforts to end war.
%%Critical Thinking a. Are those who promote war the greatest enemies of peace?*What would you like to recommend to them?*
%%Answer:
%%Yes, those who promote war are the greatest threats to peace.The profit-seekers who promote or advocate retaliation, aggression, hostility, and war are referred to as "warmongers."They always make every effort to cause chaos and destruction.They simply oppose the idea of humanity and peace.They are of the opinion that disputes should always arise.The world has suffered numerous losses thus far as a result of warmongers.Warmongers are those who keep coming up with big plans for big wars or attacks.Their perspectives on the world and its inhabitants are divergent.It makes them feel good to see both a bloody scene and a massacre.They always make every effort to harm human life.As far as they might be concerned, the idea of humankind is only a simple word.They have various issues with respect to their religion, nation and gatherings.Their affection for wars welcomes a dim future for people's presence.All of the unfortunate happenings in the world are solely the result of these warmongers.
%%I would like to suggest to all of these war criminals that things will change more quickly.You will also experience the same pains that you have shared with numerous others.Always, bad deeds are punished.One day, you will undoubtedly regret the decisions you made and the actions you took to support wars.You will never be able to live peacefully despite the pain and suffering of injured people, the cries of victims, and the curses of humanity, among other things.Try to put an end to all of your absurd ideas that harm humanity.Spread love and peace among people so that people can live in harmony and peace.
%%b. American novelist John Steinbeck, who won the Nobel Prize for literature and lived from 1902 to 1968, once said, "All war is a symptom of man's failure as a thinking animal."Do you concur with the author?*Why?*
%%Answer:
%%"Man's failure as a thinking animal explains all war."Yes, I wholeheartedly concur with this assertion.War is regarded as the worst thing on earth.It does nothing to assist anyone but destroys everything.Those nations that engage in war must bear the significant economic loss.They fight blindly for their egos and don't care about winning or losing.There is no way to solve the problem through war.War only promises a grim future for everyone.The destructive World Wars I and II are the two tragedies that will live long in people's memories.Those wars only resulted in human devastation.During that time, the world and its people suffered greatly.
%%Human foolishness and rage are the causes of wars.The rest of humanity gained a valuable lesson from those two genocides.Through history, humans have learned that war is pointless.The Second World War was regarded as the most horrific conflict in human history.That terrible war cost the lives of thousands of people.140,000 people lost their lives when atomic bombs fell on Japanese territories like Nagasaki and Hiroshima on August 6 and 9, 1945.
%%After the devastating war, people all over the world condemned the use of nuclear weapons.
%%The use of nuclear weapons was condemned by everyone else when they saw the devastation.All felt awful subsequent to seeing the terrible effects of atomic weapons.The people who used to advocate atomic weapons began denouncing its utilization in the fight.The most compromising part of atomic weapons is their bounty.They are all over.Many nations also have bombs in their arsenals that are hundreds of times more powerful than the bombs that were used to destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 by the United States.The world's future is in jeopardy.
%%Thus, wars are not at all beneficial.They simply oppose humanity.Human barbarism and withdrawal lead to wars.When civilized people sit down to eat together, they keep their differences to themselves.Human reasoning has failed as a result of the conflict, it can be said.
%%c. Does any war bring an end to all wars and establish long-term peace on earth?*Discuss.
%%Answer:
%%No, a war does not end all wars and establish long-term peace.Disorders always result from war.It only brings chaos and destruction.
%%Disagreements are the primary catalyst for the emergence of any war.The majority of the factors that lead to conflict are disagreements over ideas.
%%The most well-known form of evil on earth is war.The public does not gain anything from it.Human life and resources will only be lost as a result of this.Both the winning nation and the losing nation are responsible for significant mishaps and accidents.
%%Conflict can occasionally contribute to peace, but peace comes at the cost of death and destruction.The destruction caused by the first and second World Wars cannot be repaired.There are alternatives to war for achieving peace.There are numerous other choices, including negotiating a fair solution for everyone.Rather than choosing war, there are numerous other options for achieving peace.We can initiate coordination among the warring nations and a peace settlement.The arrangement that benefits both parties will continue.Some conditions will be accepted by some people while others won't.
%%Any solution is two steps behind understanding and agreement.Wars are a direct result of egos being so dangerous.Religion, gender, sexism, and national boundaries separate us from one another, but we share a place with humanity.We ought to assist one another and treat one another as if we were brothers and sisters.There will undoubtedly be contradictions that need to be resolved calmly.
%%Therefore, for the benefit of humanity, wars should be avoided.If there is to be long-term peace in the world, peaceful methods of negotiation must be sought.
%%d. Why do you think nations start wars despite having their own borders?*
%%Answer:
%%I believe that a variety of factors related to their actions cause nations to engage in wars despite having their own boundaries.These reasons might be self images, envy and something different like these.Countries with a lot of power always try to control their smaller, less powerful neighbors.Most of the time, they try to be outgoing while being generous to others.However, they actually seek their benefits.They sneakily invade neighboring nations' territories.They even pillage their neighbors and lend a helping hand to them.The actions of powerful nations always have negative repercussions.Terrorism rises as a result of these acts, and bad things happen.It causes nations to become hostile.
%%There are a lot of nations in the world that are envious of the progress made by their neighbors.Even though they have their own borders, they get restless when they see how their neighbors are developing.They start their bad plans by using politics to cause trouble in the countries that come after them.Most of the time, the world's large, powerful nations are blamed for causing problems in their smaller, weaker counterparts.They constantly attempt to play their dirty politics in other nations.They have issues with relationships with other nations.They always react badly when their neighbors establish good relationships with larger nations.
%%As a result, wars can occur at any time.The citizens of the two nations become increasingly antagonistic as a result of these activities.As of now, wars occur and welcome terrible results.
Write essays in about 500 words on the following topics.*
%%Answer:
%%                       War and Peace* 
%%War is regarded as a terrible thing.  It refers to an armed battle between countries.  War causes great suffering for all. It is against all the living beings on this planet. It invites a dark future for all. Due to war, humanity has to suffer a lot. War never sees nations, people, relationships etc. It only causes destruction and provides pain to all.

%%Wars break out for various reasons.  Some wars take place between countries or nations and within a nation.  The latter is generally referred to as a civil war and may result from differences on the basis of caste, religion, or socioeconomic dissatisfaction.  Whether there are wars between countries (interstate) or between different classes of communities within the country, the effects are very harmful.

%%During wars, everywhere there is massive destruction of property, wealth, trade, industry etc.  It completely disturbs the overall aspects of the life of the people. The main reasons behind wars are egos, jealousy, pride etc among the people and the nations. When people aren't ready to settle their disputes peacefully, wars take place. Wars and their results only invite huge loss and destruction.

%%The term peace means a state of tranquillity, quiet, and harmony; absence of violence. Peace is a state of complete freedom from disturbance.  It refers to the particular time when there is no war or fighting between nations.  Peace is possible if the world begins to recognize that wars are unnecessary and against humanity. For this, the people of the entire world have to decide to end war altogether. In this state, they will surely find a way to peaceful coexistence.
%%
%%

%%Human beings' always prefer peace. The demand for peace is universal.  Human beings are calm by their nature.  War does not provide any evidence of the idea that human beings are fighting animals.  Even the acts of war don't finish human's innate love for peace.

%%In the modern world, modern people are threatened by terrible inventions of science and technology.  But the real danger is not coming from science but from the war, in which the power of science and technology is misused by people.

%%Through wars, nations keep themselves powerful and save their nations from others but wars are the means to instil a fierce sense of aggression and destruction among people.

%%Thus, all the nations who involve themselves in wars must realise the importance of peace for the welfare of humanity. Everyone wants to have a peaceful existence. Wars never favour anyone. It only knows to invite a dark future for all. Human beings should avoid wars at all costs.  The only way to secure our lives and ensure stability in our countries is to practice tolerance and respect for one another.  Otherwise, due to wars, we too would have become extinct like the dinosaurs!

%%        
%%        Provide responses to these inquiries.*
%%a. What distinguishes the soul from the body?*
%%Answer:
%%The soul is only present in time and space (unseen), whereas the body is present in time and space (seen).In this context, the physical and spiritual aspects of the body and soul are distinct.
%%b. What do you think the psychologists mean when they say that there is no such thing as a mind?*
%%Answer:
%%I understand the psychologists' belief that there is no such thing as mind from their statement that there is no such thing.
%%c. In what way can a mental activity be converted into a physical one?*
%%Answer:
%%With the assistance of body functions, a mental activity can be reduced to a physical one.When the body starts to function, mental activities can be reduced much more quickly than mental activities.The mind gets a lot of rest because the body works so much.
%%d. How are the body and mind connected?*
%%Answer:
%%Because the mind is an emanation (source) of the body and the body is an invention of the mind, there is a connection between the two.These two aspects are merely useful strategies for event planning.
%%e. How do the mind and memory relate to one another?*Does a person's memory last after they die?*
%%Answer:
%%Memory is the most fundamental feature of the mind, so there is a connection between the mind and memory.No, a person's memory does not last after they die.Memory is linked to a particular brain structure.This structure also deteriorates with death, and memory ceases to function.
%%f. In what way is the sun the sole source of our power on Earth?*
%%Answer:
%%The sun, which provides energy to all living things, is the sole source of our power on Earth.Everyone has been able to eat and live thanks to the sun's heat energy.
%%Critical Thinking*
%% a. Do you think there is such a thing as a soul?*Compose your contentions on the side of your response.
%%Answer:
%%Yes, I do think that soul exists.People all over the world have a great deal of faith in God's existence and divinity.This faith is quite prevalent across all religions and is quite strong.All of these well-established religions talk about how great God is and that different things exist.The human soul and even stories about the afterlife are mentioned in the majority of religious books.They believe in the soul and a variety of supernatural powers, despite the fact that no one has ever actually seen the soul.They have believed in these unbelievable forces due to their strong religious faith.because I am also a Hindu and very religious.Numerous unbelievable events that defy our imagination are mentioned in Hindu mythology.People in this world use the name "God" to refer to the most powerful being on this planet.God is regarded as a holy soul that transcends all living things on earth.In addition, God is referred to as the universe's creator.
%%These questions are the subject of numerous debates.Its meanings are explained in many popular dictionaries as well.The term "soul" refers to a person's spirit or essence, which is typically understood to include a person's thoughts and personality.Frequently believed to persist after death.Although it vanishes, the soul remains on this planet.Religious texts assert that a person's soul separates from their body upon death.On this planet, it never stops moving.The soul undergoes numerous tests before ultimately being placed in heaven or hell.To enter heaven, the person's soul must be cleansed and sanctified.I'm a religious guy who believes in the soul even though I haven't seen one in person.
%%b. You must first change your mind before you can change your body.Discuss.*
%%Answer:
%%Throughout their entire lives, humans engage in a wide range of activities.The minds control all of these activities.The nature and direction of human actions are determined by the subtle and imperceptible thoughts and feelings that arise in the mind.
%%One of the body's most powerful organs is the mind.It controls every other organ's function.At the point when our brains are temperamental or don't work as expected, they influence the entire working of our bodies.The key to success in all areas of life is physical and emotional fitness.The effects of mental illness must be understood by everyone.Maintaining a healthy mind must be of the utmost importance to everyone.As they are conscious of maintaining their physical health, they should exercise caution regarding their minds.
%%A state of psychological well-being is what we mean when we say fitness of the mind.It makes us feel, think, and act better, which makes it easier for us to enjoy life.It enhances the capacity for inner self-determination.It's a lively, upbeat word that gets rid of any negative thoughts that come to mind.Psychologists, mental health professionals, schools, organizations, and the general public are increasingly using the term "mental fitness" to refer to the capacity for logical thinking, clear comprehension, and reasoning.
%%Mental and physical health cannot be separated from one another.Both are extremely significant.If a person's mental and physical health are in balance and work well together, they are considered fit and healthy.As a result, everyone must first change their minds.We observe automatic changes in our bodies if our minds function properly.Everyone on this planet needs to work toward striking a healthy balance between their mental and physical health, and they also need to seek the assistance they require when either of them becomes unstable.
%% WRITING*
%% Write thoughtfully about the given subjects.*
%%a. God's Existence Response:*
%%The existence of God is understood or believed to be a reality by the various religions, religious leaders, and people around the world.Regarding this statement, they make no concessions.However, I believe that believers' judgments regarding the existence of God vary significantly and fall into distinct categories.The people's understanding and beliefs are the foundation for all of these religious claims.When it comes to their sources of information regarding the existence of God, religious leaders are extremely confident.They start acting aggressively toward anyone who tries to oppose them or raises a question about the existence of the all-powerful God.For these strict pioneers, the presence of God is correct and God is just the expectation for people's endurance.
%%As is the case with me as well, whenever I feel guilty, I pray to God for justifications.Even though I haven't seen God, I always think about God with fear.My belief in God always stops me from doing bad things.I follow the paths of morality because I believe in God.When I was a child, I received religious instruction from my parents.I learned about our Gods in various forms.I believe wholeheartedly in the existence of God and offer daily praise to God.God, in my opinion, is the most powerful being who both created and safeguards all living things.Everything and nothing is unknown to God.God can be found everywhere.I do not have any evidence to support my belief in God's existence.
%%People debate the existence of the all-powerful God in this world.People have a lot of faith in God's existence even though there is no evidence to support it.Because the majority of people worldwide are associated with religions, the majority of people are on the side of God's existence.Non-religious people and those who don't believe in God are ready to die but not ready to believe in God.When they hear about God's greatness, the majority of people around the world feel good.During a period of emergency in humankind, individuals attempt to request help from the all-powerful God.They only see God as a hope for humanity's well-being.
%%b. Religion influences morality and ethics*
%%When we talk about religion, we're referring to a belief in a spiritual or metaphysical reality, often involving at least one deity, and associated practices or rituals.For billions of people around the world, religion is the primary source of moral guidance.To be moral and have good values in life, one must be religious or believe in God.People's morals and ethics are influenced by religion.
%%The majority of people today are involved in religion.Religious activities are done by people from the time they are born until they die.Religion, ethics, and morality are all intertwined concepts.There is a strong connection between religion and ethical qualities.
%%By giving people the impression that they are a part of a larger culture, religion can make them feel better about themselves.The confidence of all strict individuals is exceptionally high, and they are areas of strength for intellectually.Morality and ethics are encouraged by religion.It always imparts knowledge about forgiveness.It inspires inner strength to act ethically in life.
%%People are kept within moral and ethnic bounds by religion.It teaches deep convictions about ideals, ethical quality, feeling of dread toward God, sin and karma or heavenly equity in individuals.It is because they believe in God's rule and the promise of the Bible that a large number of people still hold to morals and values.Every religion teaches its adherents to cultivate virtue, adhere to God's laws, and conduct their lives in a moral manner.As a result, religions are the world's true moral guardians.The world is saved from chaos and moral ambiguity by religions.People won't be able to keep their faith in the virtue of righteous living because there won't be any religions.Thus, ethics and morality are influenced by religion.It always promotes morality, goodness, and virtue.

%%Answer:
%%Young people help to shape the global culture as a result of massive technological advancements.
%%It is true that cultural identity can exist within global culture as well.Globalization fosters cultural identity by bringing people closer together.People are becoming more concerned about the uniqueness and particularity of their own culture in the new era of globalization.The significance of local knowledge and a sense of self, community, and nation are provided by cultural identity.
%%c. Why can it be expensive for newcomers to move from one part of the world to another?*
%%Answer Because the process of integrating into a new culture takes time, moving to another part of the world can be expensive for newcomers;It begins from learning the language, coordinating socially and combination into the work market.

%%Answer:
%%By starting their own businesses in their new communities, immigrants can boost the economy to varying degrees of magnitude.

%%Because the cost of isolation and non-convergence is higher and more damaging than integration, immigrants should adhere to global culture.They must then confront their anxiety about losing their identity.
%%Critical Thinking*
%% a. Do you believe that the global is localized or that the local is globalized?*Can the global culture also exist?*Give instances.
%%Answer:
%%Yes, I believe that localizes globalizes local.Globalization is a generally examined point.Because of this, putting such a complicated word into simple terms is not easy.The best food and communication networks have been made possible by globalization-related technological advancements like mobile phones, airplanes, telephones, and the Internet, among other things.As a result, people and nations can exchange goods and information more quickly and with less difficulty.Globalization is the name given to this process.The term "globalization" refers to the bringing together of nations from all over the world.
%%The process by which local people are influenced by global culture, goods, and media, among other things, is referred to as "globalization."I believe that local has become globalized in the modern era due to the widespread availability of local culture, media, and products.A globalized situation is the term for this one.The process of expanding local trade all over the world is known as globalization.Many local businesses gain access to the global market as a result of this procedure.In a similar vein, global is also localized because locals can enjoy global culture and goods.There may be a worldwide culture which is a side-effect of globalization.People in this situation experience the global culture in a variety of areas, including sports, education, music, food, fashion, language, and other areas.
%%In fact, it is the process of uniting the world.Local communities' perceptions of the world as a result of globalization are known as globalization.While globalization is the adaptation of a specific property to fit the demands of various societies and regions, the restriction refers to the modification of a property or object to meet the requirements of a specific culture or region.
%%The world is getting closer together as a result of globalization, and countries actively trade goods with one another.More people can buy products at prices they can afford, but people also trade services, knowledge, cultural goods, and even languages in addition to goods and economic goods.Each of these components is interconnected and has an effect on each other.
%%b) What exactly is globalization?*Discuss how traditional cultures are affected by globalization.*
%%Answer:
%%The global process of exchanging things, information, and people is known as globalization.It comes from the word "globalize," which means the development of an international economic network.It simply refers to the globalization process.Globalization is a World Trade Organization, as we can say.Globalization is a crucial aspect of life that makes international business possible.It contributes to the growth of our nation's economy and has numerous positive effects on people's lives.
%%The process by which business and technology have made the world more interconnected and dependent is referred to as "globalization."Economic and social shifts brought about by globalization are also included in its scope.It could be compared to a massive web of cobwebs that has grown in size and breadth over thousands of years.These silk threads have been traversed by money, ideas, people, and even disease and destruction in greater numbers and at a greater rate than ever before in this age.
%%Globalization has reached local communities, where traditional values once predominated, quite rapidly in the modern world.The effects of globalization are altering these values—religion, work, and family.However, they do not alter at the same rate or with the same degree of intensity simultaneously.However, depending on generation, education, and social position, there are three possible responses.The third scenario, which involves adopting external forms of global culture (clothing, lifestyle, and consumption) while simultaneously preserving and continuing their traditional values, is utilized by the highest percentage of residents of old traditional communities.Both the older and younger generations are affected by this.Some young people dominate the first scenario, which is characterized by complete acceptance of global culture.It entails detesting conventional culture and a desire for consumption.
%%A little extent of knowledgeable occupants of conventional networks feel the past scene.This remembers cooperation for nearby culture and safeguarding conventional qualities, particularly family and religion, while simultaneously, acclimatizing general social codes and taking part in worldwide culture.
%%Globalization's effects on traditional cultures:
%%Worker disparity is getting worse:
%%Globalization has the potential to exacerbate global inequality by fostering trade and specialization.It causes global relative poverty by increasing trade per capita income.
%%Increasing unemployment:
%%The unemployment rate may rise as a result of globalization.It requires low-cost, high-efficiency work.Unemployment rates can rise in nations where businesses are unable to produce workers with high levels of skill.
%%Trade imbalances are getting worse:
%%The ratio of goods and services exported to those imported is known as the balance of trade.As a result of globalization, this ratio is unbalanced because any nation can trade with any other nation.It's also known as a "trade deficit."Trade imbalances in developed nations have grown over the past few years as a result of market competition.
%%Environmental Damage:
%%As a result of globalization, industrialization is progressing at a faster rate in this world.Industrialization has negative effects on the environment as well as economic growth.The use of harmful fertilizers and solutions by various chemical industries around the world or the release of industrial wastes into the natural world pose risks to both human life and the environment.
%%The exploitation of low-paying jobs:
%%Businesses are able to create jobs and improve economic prospects in developing nations thanks to globalization, which frequently results in lower labor costs.However, in these developing nations, globalization may impede or worse, halt overall economic expansion.

%%C. Write a news story to be published in a newspaper about a local festival/fair you have witnessed.*
%%
%%Answer:
%%               Dipawali: A Festival of Joy
%%Kantipur Post
%%20-02-2021
%%Nepal is a land of festivals.  All Nepalese people celebrate different festivals within a year.  This is because Nepal has a centuries-old heritage and great cultural diversity.  All the different religious and ethnic groups have different cultural festivals.  I have recently witnessed the festival of Dipawali.  Diwali is one of the festivals of Hindus which is celebrated in unison and with most pomp.  It is celebrated by almost all communities and all religions, even though its importance varies in different communities.

%%Dipawali is regarded as the festival of lights.  Thousands of oil lamps are lit in or around the houses.  Its preparation starts a few days before the festival.  People clean all their houses and all around.  The houses are whitewashed or painted.  Diwali begins with the festival of crows.  People offer prayers and good food to the crows.  The next day is the festival of dogs.  On this day, good food items are provided to the dogs. People worship dogs with flowers and garlands.

%%The next day is the festival of cows.  It is also known as Lakshmi Puja.  Hindus consider the cow as Lakshmi.  Hence, on this day cows are offered prayers and good food items.  Hindus believe that if Lakshmi becomes happy, a lot of money is offered to them.  On the evening of this day, there is a view of the bride in every house and shop.  There is a huge crowd, especially at the sweets and crackers shops.  The next day is also celebrated in the same way.  This day is known as Ox-Tihar and oxen are worshipped.  The last day is called Vai-Tika.  On this day brothers are worshipped by their sisters. Hindus believe that by doing this their brothers are protected with prosperity along with a long life.

%%People celebrate this festival in different ways.  Children seem to be happiest enjoying the festival.  But it is a pity that many foolish people celebrate this holy day by drinking and gambling all night long.  Many of them get wasted and later regret it.  Some children catch fire while playing with crackers.

%%
%%Thus, Dipawali brings immense happiness to all. The only thing is that we need to be alert about misusing our joyous time during this festival.

%%CRITICAL THINKING 
%%
%%a. What kind of divided identity is depicted in the novel Half A Life?* How do characters in the novel try to create new identities for themselves?* Explain.
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%V. S Naipaul's novel "Half a Life" is about a divided identity and its search. Here in this novel, we find the main protagonist Willie Somerset Chandran struggles in various places for his identity. This novel portrayed his divided identity and his struggles in his quest for self-knowledge.  V.S Naipaul has very skillfully manipulated the colonial plight of the protagonist Willie Somerset Chandran, his anxiety, disorganization and search for his own identity from different places as India to England, England to Africa and then Germany to rediscover his own identity, Yet he loses his true identity.

%%The protagonist, Willie Somerset Chandran had caste issues in his family. His father belonged to a Brahmin family heritage. He married a woman of low caste. Later, he regretted living in that disastrous union. But, the caste issue of his parents made him feel upset. The protagonist moved from India to London, where, in a new colony of immigrants, he started living with a new identity.  He suppressed his self-doubt through sexual adventures and struggles in a writer attempt that brings him to the brink of exhaustion, from where he is saved, only by the love of a good woman Ana.  Together they returned to their home to live out the last ruined days of colonialism, while Willie Chandran remained a passive bystander in another life that is not his own. Here, the characters try their best to create new identities for themselves. They are seen leaving their own status and roaming different places to create their new identities and live their lives without any discrimination.


%%b. Discuss the similaries between the author and the protagonist in the noivel?*
%%
%%Answer:
%%
%%The similaries between the author and the protagonist in the novel are as follows:

%% ▪︎  The author's perception of isolation in the wider world, and his cautious history of life and travels in his life can be found in the life of this novel's protagonist, Willie Somerset Chandran. 

%% ▪︎  By the time of Naipaul's early childhood memories, chicken and fish were eaten at the family dinner table, and Christmas was celebrated with dinner, which is associated with the protagonist's middle name, Willie Somerset Chandran.

%% ▪︎ The author later considered that the scholarship would have allowed him to study any subject at any institution in the higher Commonwealth and, likewise, the protagonist in the novel also gets the chance to learn in Britain through a scholarship for higher studies. 

%%
%% ▪︎  Earlier in 1952, in a college play, Naipaul had got a chance to meet history student Patricia Ann Hale.  Hale and Naipaul form a close friendship, which eventually develops into a sexual relationship.  With Hale's support, Naipaul began to recover and slowly began to write.  In the same way, the protagonist meets a girl as well as a good reader of his books, who loves him dearly and later marries him.

%%REPORTED SPEECH*

%%Answer:

%%The author felt that she was lucky to be so naive (innocent) of her freshmen year at college because that very ignorance explored her to the path of abundance and status. The absence of information and experience encouraged her to get the joy of discovering the world.
%%b) Why did she say that she went to college in the Stone Age?*
%%Answer: 
%%She said that she went to college in the Stone Age because she found vast differences comparing her and her son's college years. She found vast changes in science and technology in the colleges of her time and the present time. The technological things which were quite popular then are the tools of disposal in the present time.

%%Hyden can use quite advanced technological tools at his college life unlike at his mother's time. He can use almost everything he does, large and small. He uses a mobile phone with Yale specific apps, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube.

%%Answer:
%%Internet and social sites have affected the lifestyle of the youths in the following ways:
%% ▪︎  Youths in the present are fully dependent on the internet and social sites.

%% ▪︎  They have been doing their project works depending on search engines of social sites apart from thinking and creativity. 
%% ▪︎  They are seen quite away from the real world. Their connection with other people depends on virtual means. The Internet has alienated youths from the real world.
%% ▪︎  Due to the internet and social sites, youths have missed the actual delight of discovering the real world.

%%Answer:
%%Unlike his mother, Hayden will miss the creative thinking ability and the delight of discovering the real world.
%%f. The writer says, "I worry that students today are more connected and more fragmented." Isn't this paradoxical?* How?*
%%Answer: 
%%The line " I worry that students today are more connected and more fragmented." is paradoxical.  This line has self-contradictory properties. As we know there is no fragmentation in connection but the above line suggests different meanings regarding the youths. In the present time, youths are connected virtually through social sites, but in the real world, they are quite far from each other. They don't have a person to person relation so they are fragmented. There is no exposure to each other to gain life's memorable moments.
%%CRITICAL THINKING* 
%%a. Do you think that advancements of technology can hinder the exposure students receive in school, and block them from gaining some of life’s most memorable moments?* Give reasons in support of your answer.
%%Answer:
%%Yes, I think that advancements of technology can hinder the exposure students receive in school, and block them from gaining some of life’s most memorable moments. In this modern world, technology has played quite a vital role in everyone's life. Every single person is spending his/her life on the network of the internet. The internet has become one of the most influential advancements in technology. In this world of media and communication, the internet has brought a kind of revolution for all. The Internet has become an integral part of human lives. In the present time, we cannot imagine our life without the internet. 
%%In today's world, most people are habitually in the surrender of advancements of technology. For humans, technical gadgets have become closer than anything else. When people feel lonely, they engage themselves with gadgets. A person doesn't seek a person to talk to, he/she needs gadgets instead.
%%Talking about students, they are seen much affected by technology nowadays. There are lots of knowledge-related things available in the internet technology but these pieces of knowledge are quite away from the reality of the world. Internet technology hinders the exposure students receive in school, and deprives them of gaining some of life’s most memorable moments. Nowadays, students are seen as busy most of the time with their modern gadgets. They have made their world in the imaginative world of the internet. Their life seems limited within the technological world. They have become quite away from this real world. The advancements of technology have blocked them from doing struggle, hard labour, duties and responsibilities. They have become one-sided. They have forgotten to enjoy and find happiness in this real world of relationships. They have been living their lives being alienated. Though they are in contact with people on social networks, they are completely away from real meetings. 
%%Thus, the advancements in technology have created such an environment for students where they are quite away from their life's memorable moments. 
%%b. Kline’s essay focuses on the contrast between her son’s freshman college experience and her own, but she also establishes what they have in common. Explain.
%%Answer:
%%Kline's essay titled "Taking My son to College, Where Technology Has Taken Out Serendipity" focuses on the contrast between her son’s freshman college experience and her own, but she also establishes what they have in common. This essay is about the gap between her school's understanding and her child's knowledge.  However, the lesson also covers the basics between her and her child. Here in this essay, Kline has talked about the experience of the freshman college year at the same university. 
%%Talking about Freshman college, the technology during her time was completely different from that of her son's time. But the system of education in the college was the same. The emotions and feelings of students were also the same. Talking about difficulties in the life of students, she faced many difficulties in her studies in comparison to her son's studies but the sense of friendship and teamwork was the same. During her time, much physical effort was needed to make discoveries and research projects, but for her son, such tasks are done through technical means. The assignments' discovery and research projects were the same.
%%The way of doing tasks was only different. Her son moved through search engines, through e-books instead of physical books.  During her time in college, relationships and friendships were a kind of struggle for newcomers. But for her son, the search for a partner was just a key. The relationship was the same but the way of making was different. 
%%c. Has internet aided to broadening or narrowing the critical thinking capacity of youths or readers?* How?*
%%Answer:
%%The answer to this question is both the yes and the no. As we know, everything on this planet has two sides. The internet has aided in broadening knowledge if we use the internet to find and explore knowledge curiously. But, if we start relying on interactive answers with blunt creativity, it reduces our abilities to think.
%%Reading and learning tasks from the internet aren't considered reliable. But there are lots of useful and important things on the internet for all of us to gain varieties of knowledge. Most youths and readers engage themselves on the internet to search for their queries. Most users seem to rely on it most of the time. This act of relying completely on the internet hinders the capacity of critical thinking. Those who rely on the internet for solutions never increase their capacity of reasoning and analysis. The Internet doesn't allow someone to think much about solutions. It helps in all sectors and makes readers or youths passive. 

%%Most readers and youth of the present seem unable to make use of their logic. In case of any problem, they don't use their minds' logical solutions. They search for their problems immediately on the internet. People have forgotten their actual reasonings. They seem totally dependent on the internet. 

%%Thus, it reduces the thinking skills of all. It paves shortcut ways for all where mind labour is less used.

%%B. Interpret the information given in the following chart.*
%%The bar chart given above shows the frequency of eating at fast food restaurants among people in the USA in three years 2003, 2006, and 2013. 
Here in this bar diagram, overall, we can see that in all three years, the proportion of people who visit and eat at fast food restaurants every day and never was less than 5%.
Here we find more people ate at fast food restaurants once a week or once or twice a month during the given period. While in 2003, the proportion of those who ate fast food once a week was 31%, it increased slightly over the next three years to 33% in 2006.  By 2013 this had dropped to 27%.  In 2003, 30% of people ate at fast food restaurants once or twice a month, and in 2006 this figure dropped to 25%.
However, it increased over the next 7 years, and in 2013, 33% of people visited fast food restaurants. 
Fast food eaters several times a week remained between 15% and 20% in all three years and were the highest (20%) in 2006.  Meanwhile, the proportion of fast food eaters only a few times a year remained more or less the same in all years at about 15%.

        %%Answer:
        %%Yes, traveling is a passion of mine.People travel for both entertainment and education.
        %%Provide responses to the following inquiries:*
        %%a. When the author saw a colorful rooster in the western Himalayas, how did she feel?*

        %%The creator felt entertained when she saw a vivid chicken in the western Himalayas.
        %%b. In what manner does she describe the houses along the western Nepal trail?*

        %%Critical Thinking a. It is said that traveling to a new place is equivalent to reading three books.Do you concur?*Why?*
        %%Answer:
        %%Yes, I wholeheartedly concur with this statement that traveling to a new location is equivalent to reading three books.I think that the world as a whole is like a great book in which everyone can learn a lot.Through the pages of their books, bookish people never gain access to real-world facts or other knowledge.
        %%When we travel, we have the chance to learn a variety of new things that help us expand our minds.Traveling exposes us to the authenticity of knowledge and entertainment when we are away from books.Without the benefit of a real visual experience, readers are constrained by the content of the books they read.But traveling always gives you firsthand knowledge and experience of a place, which makes you happy and interested in finding true facts through observation.The readers of the books may forget what they read, but the travelers always remember the place they visited.Traveling lets people see a place from a different perspective, and the experience stays with them for the rest of their lives.Reading also gives us a lot of information about places, but actually going there and exploring them might be much more fun and appealing.
        %%Knowing things is part of traveling.A person who travels learns about a variety of aspects of their life.He or she is familiar with various people and places.He or she has the chance to learn about the languages, cultures, and ways of life of other people.Every day, the traveler has the chance to learn something new.He or she discovers a freshness within themselves.As he or she experiences something new while traveling, his or her perspective shifts.Traveling gives the impression of global unity.Travelers always find a way to connect with other people.Consequently, traveling is a wonderful experience for acquiring facts-related knowledge.It goes far beyond simply reading.
        %%b. The author walked the western Himalayas for five weeks.Do you believe it was risky?*Why?*
        %%Answer:
        %%The author has written about her adventurous five-week trip to western Nepal in this travelogue.Yes, I think it was adventurous because she covered 25% of Nepal's Himalayan region via the Lower Great Himalayan route and took some amazing side trips along the way.She saw and went to places in the Himalayas that are only visited by a select few tourists.
        %%Her journey was quite risky because she saw a lot of new, different, and exciting places.She went on a journey to West Nepal, where she discovered a variety of strange and beautiful natural wonders hidden from view.She met various individuals and arrived at such odd spots that entertained her much.She decided to walk the Dhaulagiri circuit, which is quite challenging geographically.She most of the time traveled the difficult, sloping, and steep path with snow-capped Himalayan peaks like Mt. Dhaulagiri.During her excursion, she needed to stroll all over getting opposite one rich green slope to another, through warm mild timberlands, under monster cobwebs, to investigate normal marvels and Nepalese culture and ways of life.She finds it so challenging to trek through a variety of challenging trails, including crossing rivers, walking through arid areas, traversing moving glaciers, spending chilly nights at high altitudes, and walking in frozen snow.As a result, she took a truly daring journey on this one.
        %%A. In about 300 words, write a travelogue about your most recent visit to a natural or religious location.Make use of the hints below.*
        %%A Memorable Journey of TauthalI in Sindhupalchok Tauthali is one of the really beautiful places in the Sindhupalchok district.

        %%As was the case with us, we made the most of our two important days by exploring various stunning locations in Tauthali.During that journey, our group consisted of four individuals.This location can be reached in four to five hours by bus or taxi from Kathmandu.From the bus station, we can simply board an Arniko Transportation bus.From Kathmandu, all it takes to get there is a ticket for 300 rupees.This location is mostly visited by bicycles.It's very appealing and fun to take a bus right next to the Sunkoshi River.At 11:40 a.m., our group took a bus there, and we arrived at 4:45 p.m. A brand-new pool is located somewhere between Damside and Lamosanghu.We must then leave the Arniko Highway and ascend the gravel road from there.Tekanpur, a charming little village, is located on the road leading to the village.When we saw Tauthali Bazar, we were ecstatic.The Tauthali market is so fascinating.The majority of residents are Newars, and the majority of them speak Newari.The Tauthali people lived very simple lives, according to us.They hold their religion in high regard.Tauthali is a location with historical and cultural significance.The following day, we went to the religious Tauthali temple.In most of Tauthali, we discovered ancient artifacts.It's nice to look at the woods and open green field in the sloppy area.In terms of amenities, we were able to book excellent rooms for two days at a reasonable cost.In Tauthali, we were able to purchase some quite delectable foods.Our two-day journey through Sindhupalchok was a lot of fun.
        %%B. Write a 500-word essay about the "Importance of Tourism in Nepal."Important) Response:*
