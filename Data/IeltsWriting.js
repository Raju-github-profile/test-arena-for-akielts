    title: 'WHAT IS IELTS WRITING?',
    description: `IELTS WRITING	is a task that weighs your aptitude of vocabulary, cohesion and coherence, your grammar and most importantly how you express your thoughts. That is to say, how skillfully you can express yourself through writing. IELTS checks your writing capability to confirm if you can do your assignments given by your lecturers and professors of the university while you will be studying in an English speaking country. It is one of most important modules of the IELTS test because this module somewhat influences your visa grant status.
        %%There are two ways you are assessed. Number one is by examining your interpretation of graphs, charts, table, map and diagram through Writing Task I and secondly, by checking your analytical and discussion skills though Writing Task II where you will be asked different opinion and discussion questions. The time allotted for Task I is 20 minutes where you should write at least 150 words report and the Task II is a 40 minutes test where you should write not less than 250 words essay.
        %%It is the writing task when most of the Nepalese students struggle. The reason behind this is their schooling. In schools of Nepal both private and community students are trained only to parrot the notes given by the teacher which has proved to be the biggest hindrance of their analytical skills. Moreover, the students are not taught to write analytical essays rather they are only taught to write descriptive ones, most of the times and they are not commented upon the coherence and cohesion, vocabularies of the essay. This has not helped students and when they opt for abroad studies their major setback becomes their writing skills. 
        %%Writing task in IELTS is way too different from what you have learnt till date. It is not like writing essays on Rivers or Mountains of Nepal. You need to be very cautious about what the examiner wants you to discuss or present your opinion on. Therefore, even the faintest of mistakes can cost you a lot of scores. It is the writing task because of which many Nepalese students don’t get their desired scores and they invest a lot of money just to appear exam again and again.
        %%Therefore, in this lesson we will learn how to write essays that are accurate, coherent, grammatically correct and with good vocabularies. We will also learn to use collocations, about how to paraphrase, give examples. 
  %%  Aspects of Writing Task*
%%• Paraphrasing
%%• Using Synonyms%%• Using different kinds of Sentences
%%• Using collocations
%%• Using uncommon Vocabularies
%%• Sticking with the topic
%%• Organizing your ideas coherently
%%• Presenting opinions
%%• Discussing topics
%%• Explaining topics
%%• Supporting Topics with suitable examples
%%• Managing time
%%These are some of the skills you need to master if you want to excel in the both the writing tasks. 
%%	HOW TO PARAPHRASE?*
%%Paraphrasing is rewriting the statement using synonyms, by changing the structure of the sentence or by changing the forms of the words but without changing the meaning of the statement or the sentence.
%%Here are some examples;
%%1.	Paraphrasing is one of the essential skills that a student must have before taking IELTS test.
%%Paraphrased:- One of the most important abilities that a student must develop prior to taking IELTS test is that he or she must learn how to paraphrase.
%%2.	The maps show improvements made to a university campus between 2010 and the present day.
%%Paraphrased:- The maps illustrate the upgrade that the university campus went through between 2010 and now.
%%Paraphrased:- The maps display the university campus that was developed between 2010 and now.
%%	Methods to Paraphrase* :
%%1.	Using Synonyms*:%%
Synonyms are the different words but convey the same meaning. For example, ‘house’ is a synonym of ‘home’, ‘residence’, ‘apartment’, ‘dwelling’. This method is simply used to replace the words given in the statement or question to produce a new sentence keeping the meaning same.
For example:
%%My house needs a renovation.
%%My residence requires a refurbishment.
%%Here you can see that I have replaced three words with the new words. I have replaced ‘house’ with ‘residence’, ‘needs’ with ‘requires’ and ‘renovation’ with ‘refurbishment’. However, I have not change the overall meaning of the first sentence and the tense of that sentence is also intact.
%%This is the most common technique that students can use to paraphrase if used effectively but there always remains a danger of using similar meaning but not the same meaning. Similar meanings are not good to use because you will lose marks. Here is one example of such.
%%Violent crimes are on the rise among teenagers.
%%Violent offences are rising among young people.
%%Look at the example carefully. You can see that I have replaced ‘teenagers’ with ‘young people’. Yes, teenagers are not old but young people but people between 20 and 30 can also be termed as young people. Here, the examiner does not get what exactly you mean. Therefore, it is not the exact synonym but the loose synonym. The exact term would be ‘adolescents’. Therefore, the more accurate paraphrase would be,
%%Violent offences are rising among adolescents.
%%You must therefore be 100 percent sure before using a synonym.  
%%2.	Change the order of the word*.%%
%%It is very beneficial when you change the word order in order to paraphrase but you should not forget that while doing this you should not change the overall meaning of the statement, make the sentence grammatically incorrect. After applying this method it is up to you to make sure that the sentence is absolutely correct grammatically because IELTS judges you on the basis of your ability to produce error free sentences.
%%Luckily, there are two ways to change the word order.
%%	You can always change the order of the clauses, if the sentence has more than one clause.
%%Question: As languages such as Nepali, Hindi and French are being widely used, people fear that many marginalized languages may vanish.
%%Paraphrased:  People fear that many marginalized languages may vanish, as languages such as Nepali, Hindi and French are being widely used.
%%We can always change the word order but in addition to it we can add some synonyms to paraphrase it in even better way.
%%Paraphrased: People dread that the scarcely used languages may extinct, as languages like Nepali, Hindi and French are being more broadly spoken. 
%%	You can also change the word order if there is an adjective or a noun in the question. You can do this by just by altering the adjective into a relative clause.
%%Question: Learning to manage money is one of the key aspects to adult life.
%%Paraphrased: Learning to manage money is one of the aspects to adult life that is key.
%%3.	Change the Form of the Word*%%

%%There are various forms of words such as Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives and Adverbs. That is the reason; you must already know grammar before joining IELTS classes. Changing the form allows you to paraphrase the sentence effectively. Changing the form of a word means changing adverbs to adjectives, nouns to adjectives, verbs to nouns and vice versa. For example, ‘rain’ is a noun but it can be changed to ‘rainy’ which is an adjective. Similarly, ‘significant’ is an adjective, but it can be change to ‘significantly’ which is an adverb. In the same way, ‘to confuse’ is a verb, but it can be changed to ‘confusion’ which is a noun. You can also change the forms of verbs, below is an example. And finally you must be absolutely sure while changing the form of a word.
%%Question: Longer life spans and progressed health of elderly population indicate that citizens over sixty-five in age can continue to live active lives.
%%Paraphrased: Longer life spans and progressed health of elderly population are indicating that citizens over sixty-five in age can continue living active lives.
%%Here, the word ‘suggests’ and ‘can live’ are changed to ‘are suggesting’ and ‘living’ respectively. Infinitive forms of verbs are change to Present Participle.
%%4.	Change from Active to Passive*
%%You can also change the active or passive into passive and active voice respectively. But for that you must know the rules of active and passive voice change, beforehand. The golden rule is only verbs with an object can be changed into passive.

%%Active sentence: The property developers invested $20 million in the development of the shopping centre.

%%Passive sentence: $20 million was invested in the development of shopping centers by the property developers.

%%Example active: People say that global warming is caused by the burning of fossil fuels.%%

%%Example passive: Global warming is said to be caused by the burning of fossil fuels.%%
%%At the end, if you ask which method to use? I would say use all the methods if possible at the same time but keep in mind the grammatical accuracy. If you are not sure, choose a method you like and use that always whenever you practise your test at home. Having said that, always bear in mind that using synonyms are dangerous, be careful. 
%%You may feel, “I have used this method so many times, it is not good”. However, the thing is if you use several times you may feel bored, but at the same time you feel confident to use it due to enough practice. Interestingly, the examiner only sees you using it only once while he checks your answer after your IELTS test. 
%%A free piece of advice: Always keep this in mind, you are not practicing for enjoyment, but you are practicing for your better life ahead. So you must be more concerned about your future than your enjoyment and detest.
 %%	How to write Complex Sentences?*
%%‘Complex’ is just a label not a description.
%%Most of the students make the same mistake of showing off in IELTS writing and become excessively ambitious to show their grammatical range. This is because many students make up an opinion that they need to write many complex sentences to make their writing elite but in fact the truth is not what they think. This happens because they do not know what a complex sentence is. Complex sentence does not mean it has to be complicated rather it is just a mix of two or more simple sentences. Trying to like too long and complicated sentences lead to grammatical mistakes which makes the sentences difficult to understand and ultimately they lose score. The mantra is to keep it simple.
%%Let’s now look at the example:
%%These are four simple sentences which we will put together and try to produce a new complex sentence. However, if you choose to write only simple sentences in your IELTS writing task, you will not only loose marks but also your writing becomes too simple. In addition to that, the marking criteria clearly states that if you need a band score 7 you must write variety of complex structures.
%%•	Global warming is a common topic these days.
%%•	Global warming causes environmental problems.
%%•	There are tough challenges associated with global warming.
%%•	Global warming has very serious consequences.
%%Combining these four simple sentences to produce a complex sentence
%%‘In the modern world, global warming is one of the most popular topics causing many environmental difficulties and tough challenges arising from its serious consequences.’
%%This is a typical example of an overtly complicated sentence. Most of the students do this and the sentence becomes awkward and incoherent. I would call it a stunt without strings attached. It may seem very daring but it does not have a desired outcome. Any student who does this is clearly giving a hint that they have lost control of the grammar which has affected the meaning of the sentence badly. When the meaning is affected it makes the examiner difficult to understand and you lose score. 
%%At this point you need to understand that only combining sentence does not help you score well but it needs to be grammatically correct and meaningful. So, my advice to you is that use two points to make a complex sentence and other two points to make another. You do not have to write too long sentences. 
%%If you would ask me how to make complex sentences, I would answer to you by saying that you must use complex sentences in the explanation sentence. It is okay to use simple sentence in the topic sentence. You can make a complex sentence by joining two or more simple sentences by using subordinating conjunctions. For example; after, although, as, because, before, even though, now, that, though, unless, when, where, while, because, unless, whereas, as if, whenever, if, during, as soon as, as long as, since, and until,
%%In the up-coming example, just notice how are the sentences combined and how meaningful and easy to understand it is. Also, take into consideration that complex sentence is not complex but it is just two simple sentences combined coherently to generate meaningful sentences.
%%One of the most common environmental issues is global warming which causes many serious environmental problems. There are tough challenges associated with this issue and its effects have very serious consequences.
%%Here, I have just taken the above mentioned 4 simple sentences and grouped them and put them together in two complex sentences.
%%	Collocations:
%%What is a collocation?*%%
%%Collocation is the combination of two words that intend to produce different degrees of meaning. Most of the native speakers use collocation which makes their tongue more natural compared to the non-native speakers who do not use collocation while speaking a language. Collocations in IELTS is extremely important as it helps you score band 7 or above. It is also mentioned in the marking criteria of IELTS. However, there remains a danger in collocating words together as all the words you put together may not be correct, it may sound ‘wrong’. Therefore, one should be very careful while using collocation in IELTS. For example if you say ‘quick train’ it sounds wrong as the correct collocation is ‘fast train’. Similarly, ‘quick food’ is wrong because ‘fast food’ is correct. 
%%We learn collocations because it makes our language more natural and more easily understood. It will also help us to express ourselves in more alternative and richer ways. In addition, it helps our brains to remember and use language in chunks or block rather than single words.
%%It is very important to learn collocations but the question remains how to learn them. For that we need to be aware of the collocations and we must try to pay attention whenever we see or hear them. When we come across collocations we need to learn them as a single block but never separate them as two words. Another way to learn it is that we read as much as possible and when we find one in anything we read try to use them when we write or speak. If you get into confusion about collocations you have a separate dictionary for collocation, use that frequently. The mantra here comes from the Information Technology. Unless you input there is no output.
%%	Types of collocation*
%%There are several different types of collocation made from combinations of verb, noun, adjective etc. Some of the most common types are:
%%	adverb + adjective: completely satisfied (NOT downright satisfied)
%%	adjective + noun: excruciating pain (NOT excruciating joy)
%%	noun + noun: a surge of anger (NOT a rush of anger)
%%	noun + verb: lions roar (NOT lions shout)
%%	verb + noun: commit suicide (NOT undertake suicide)
%%	verb + expression with preposition: burst into tears (NOT blow up in tears)
%%	verb + adverb: wave frantically (NOT wave feverishly)
%%Sample Collocations*
%%There are several different types of collocation. Collocations can be adjective + adverb, noun + noun, verb + noun and so on. Below you can see seven main types of collocation in sample sentences.
%%1. adverb + adjective
%%	Invading that country was an utterly stupid thing to do.
%%	We entered a richly decorated room.
%%	Are you fully aware of the implications of your action?
%%2. adjective + noun
%%	The doctor ordered him to take regular exercise.
%%	The Titanic sank on its maiden voyage.
%%	He was writhing on the ground in excruciating pain.
%%3. noun + noun
%%	Let's give Mr Jones a round of applause.
%%	The ceasefire agreement came into effect at 11am.
%%	I'd like to buy two bars of soap please.
%%4. noun + verb
%%	The lion started to roar when it heard the dog barking.
%%	Snow was falling as our plane took off.
%%	The bomb went off when he started the car engine.
%%5. Verb + noun
%%	The prisoner was hanged for committing murder.
%%	I always try to do my homework in the morning, after making my bed.
%%	He has been asked to give a presentation about his work.
%%6. Verb + expression with preposition
%%	We had to return home because we had run out of money.
%%	At first her eyes filled with horror, and then she burst into tears.
%%	Their behavior was enough to drive anybody to crime.
%%7. Verb + adverb
%%	She placed her keys gently on the table and sat down.
%%	Mary whispered softly in John's ear.
%%	I vaguely remember that it was growing dark when we left.

%%	What are the marking criteria for Writing Task and what do they mean?*
%%1.	Task Response /Achievement*
%%This criterion wants the students to report the appropriate information of the graph in their writing. You must be able to summarize and report the main features and make comparisons. In simple terms, if your report is to be given to a stranger, he should be able to draw a graph but just reading your report without looking at the graph.
%%2.	Coherence and Cohesion*
%%This criterion requires student to produce an answer that is fluent, clear, and easy to understand. It also judges students’ answer on the basis of structure, cohesive devices used, paragraphing, appropriate vocabulary and how organized the answer is. 
%%3.	Lexical Resource*

%%‘Lexicon’ in Latin means words. So ‘lexical resource’ is about the vocabulary the student has used while generating the answer. Student mistake this criterion with using lots of big and long words but actually it is about using appropriate words naturally. The words used should not create hindrance in meaning generation. This section is all about using different words naturally so that the answer is meaningful.

%%4.	Grammatical Range and Accuracy*
%%Without doubt, grammatically correct answer is what you need to do well in this section. It also demands that you show your grammatical range accurately. That means, you need to show your aptitude by writing variety of sentences while describing numbers, trends, and making comparisons. Varieties of sentences include simple sentences, passive sentences, compound sentences, complex sentences and so on. The most common mistake students make in this section is they do not use articles and plurals appropriately. If at least 50% of your sentences are not grammatically correct it is hard to score over a band 7

    description: `
        %%IELTS writing task 1 wants you to interpret and write a report on the given graphs, table, map and diagram. The graphs that you are asked to interpret are pie graph, bar graph, line graph. You are required to write a report on these in 20 minutes and the word limit is not less than 150 but you may go up to 190. In this part of IELTS writing task you are expected to select the main features from many features and also make comparisons wherever necessary.
        In the writing task you will have to know these 8 things to get a better score.
        %%1.	Foremost thing is to know how the test is marked.*
        %%When you know the marking criteria, such as; task achievement, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, and grammatical range you will know what exactly to give to the examiner.
        
        %%2.	Learn how to plan your writing answer.*
        %%Planning is a crucial skill that you let your work finish in time. Unless you plan, you may miss important features and take much longer than allotted.
        
        %%3.	Learn how to paraphrase the question.*
        %%Paraphrasing means to rewrite the question, statement using synonyms but without changing the core meaning of the question or statement. It is best to learn to paraphrase.
        
        %%4.	Learn how to select the main features.*
        %%You will come across different information while you look at the graph, map, or diagrams. Some are the main features and some are not. You will need to learn to distinguish between most important and least important features.
        
        %%5.	Learn how to write an overview.*
        %%Overview is the backbone of writing task 1. If your overview paragraph is great, you will be able to write very good body paragraphs and as it is the second paragraph of your report the examiner will have a good impression before he goes on to reading the body paragraphs. This is the paragraph where you mention the main features and the examiner will make up his/her mind about what is coming up in the supporting paragraphs.
        
        %%6.	Learn how to write the supporting paragraphs*
        %%Supporting paragraphs are those where you explain the main features with the accurate data. Therefore, learning to report the main features is one of the most important skills.
        
        %%7.	Learn how to manage time.*
        %%Time management is a very useful skill. It will help you complete your task in time.

         %%	HOW TO WRITE AN OVERVIEW PARAGRAPH?*
        %%The overview paragraph is the backbone of your writing task 1 report. By this first sentence you may have understood how important the overview paragraph is in the whole essay. As a matter of fact, it is almost impossible to score band 7 or above without an effective overview.
        An overview is simply a summary of the main and most important features of graph, chart, diagram or a map. To make it easy, I tell my students to write the most noticeable features you see while you look at the given graph, chart, map, table or a diagram for the first time. An overview paragraph is generally 2 or 3 sentences long but sometimes there can be 3 or 4 sentences depending on the question. It also influences the rest of your report. 
       %% It is the overview paragraph where an examiner looks first and tries to get the general idea about what you will be explaining in the following supporting paragraphs. In this paragraph you must introduce the specific trends, highs and lows, similarities and dissimilarities. If you learn to select the main features and make comparison between those main features, you will nail it. While selecting and writing the main features you must not (never) support anything with the data from the chart. You must take 2 or 3- at the most 4- features and write them down but remember not to support them with data, just summarize the information in the easiest way possible. To achieve it just do not write any numbers. It is also advised that you group the information in accordance with their similarities and dissimilarities. This will help you write the supporting paragraph coherently.
       %% How to select the correct features?
       %% To be able to know this, first we must know about two types of graphs and charts; static and dynamic.
       %% Static graph and charts
       %% Static, as the word suggests, it is a snapshot of a single year, month, day. You will not see two or more points of time in the question such as, ‘between 2010 and 2020’ or ‘from 2021 to 2030’ but you will see ‘in 2010’, ‘on February’.
       %% So, after you know that the given question is a static chart, you must look for following things which will assist you to select the main features. 
       %%	What are the highest/lowest values?
       %%	What are the most noticeable differences?
       %%	Any similarities?
       %%	Any significant exceptions?
        
      %%  Dynamic graph and charts
        
      %%  Opposed to static charts, Dynamic as the word suggests, it is a collection of snapshots of years, months or days which shows the differences or changes overtime. You will see two or more points of time in the question such as, ‘between 2010 and 2020’, ‘from 2021 to 2030’, ‘in 2000, 2005 and 2010’, ‘from January to December’ or ‘in May, June, July and August’.
        
      %%  As soon as you find out the given question contains dynamic charts, maps, diagram or table, you must look for the following things which will assist you to select the main features.
       %%	What does the data do from the start to the finish-(trends)?
       %%	Do they change drastically?
       %%	What are the highest increases and decreases?
       %%	Are there any that remain unchanged?
       %%	Do they generally go up or down or do they fluctuate?
       %%	Are there any significant differences from the general trend?
       %%	Overall increase/decrease?
       %%	Peaks/lows?
       %%  %%	Is there any special grammar?* 
       %% Complex sentences are the sentences with more than single clause and using complex sentence is always beneficial in terms of ‘grammatical range’ marking criteria. To do this, you can join clauses by using ‘while’, ‘although’, ‘with’, ‘even though’, ‘whereas’ or ‘and’. However, you should always be sure what these words actually mean and how they are used. While  writing an overview and the supporting paragraph always look out for the point of times, if the point of time given is in the past- use past tense, if no point of time or present point of time is mentioned- use present tense and for the future point of time- use present passive, future tense or present continuous tense.
       %%  %%	Piece of Advice
      %%  Always write an overview before you write the supporting paragraphs as it makes it clear and easy to the examiner about the main features you have identified and it also helps you absolutely while you write the supporting paragraphs. If you do this, in the ‘details’ paragraph, you will simply follow the overview paragraph’s points and support them with the accurate data. 
       %%  %%	Do I need to write a conclusion?* 
        %%No. Conclusions are really a summary of what you think or opinions. This is not an opinion essay and you, therefore, do not need to write a conclusion. Save your conclusions for task 2.
       %%  %%	Examples of some overview paragraphs*
       %%https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/akielts-web.appspot.com/o/writing%2F46.png?alt=media&token=5204ffc5-d48d-4979-9c5d-b2e9bc7c7a5f
        %% Example 1*:
       %% This is line graph taken from Cambridge Book 11. Here we can see the names of four different European countries (Now UK is not part of EU). In this question, the information about carbon dioxide is given from 1967 to 2007. Now before writing an overview you must first determine what kind of graph is it, static or dynamic. Since more than time period is given, it is a dynamic chart. Now come what kind of features are to be considered. In dynamic charts changes must be considered. For this focus in the trends; increase and decrease over the time period. Let’s write the overview paragraph now.
       %% Overall, United Kingdom and Sweden where two of the largest producer of carbon dioxide but they both experienced a downward trend, opposed to Italy and Portugal. However, UK despite fall claimed the highest position but Portugal in spite of increase in Carbon dioxide stayed the least.
       %% Here in the example, did you notice that I just grouped the similar looking data and wrote about their general trend and made comparison? And also I did not support any features with the data like 1967, 4 metric tons etc. 
        %%Example No 2*:
        %%https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/akielts-web.appspot.com/o/writing%2F47.jpg?alt=media&token=05dd8664-7a47-41b8-884d-30e01493a215
      %%  This is also a dynamic chart. Here too will look at the changes and group the information.
       %% Overall, fossil fuels were more used energy source compared to renewable sources. Petrol and Oil always topped the usage list whereas Hydropower was the least preferred energy source and will continue this trend into the future. It is also noticeable that all types of fuels were and will be on the rise except hydropower which stayed almost stable.
        
       %% Example 3*:
       %%https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/akielts-web.appspot.com/o/writing%2F48.png?alt=media&token=aa483852-7228-493f-a71c-0ae3af535fa4
       %% This is a static chart therefore we will look at the highs and lows and the similar values.
       %% Overall, an Australian family used most of the energy in heating and the largest amount of gas was produced by water heating whereas cooling consumed and released least amount of energy and gas respectively. However, other appliances and refrigeration used lesser amount of energy but produced higher amount of gas opposed to heating.
       %%  %%	Points to REMEMBER while writing supporting paragraph in IELTS Writing Task 1?*
       %%	First of all, read the instruction in the question. It every time in every question says, “Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant”. This means you need to be reporting the main features only and you should be making comparisons.
       %%	It is best that you group the information on the basis of date, trend, number or value.
       %%	Now that you have selected the information, divide them into 2 or 3 groups. You may relate the groups with the overview paragraph.
       %%	After you group them, start supporting the main features with the accurate data.
       %%	Since it is a formal writing, never use contractions.
       %%	If you need to mention the data that is not printed in the chart, use words like nearly, about, approximately, around to explain them. Do not include the data that is not printed on the chart or map or diagram. For example, if you are given a line graph that has the y-axis with numbers like 5-10-15 and you have to include 12, do not just write 12% or 12 million, but write nearly 12% or about 12 million, interchangeably.
       %%	Always make comparisons wherever you get a chance, it enhances your score.
       %%	Do not report everything in one paragraph. Write about similar kind of trends, values, date, and number in one paragraph and other in another paragraph. A bulk of sentences infused together makes your answer difficult to follow. 
       %%	Keep it simple; make the examiner’s work as easy as possible.
       %%	Do not make your answer complicated and uneasy to follow. It has to have a clear progression and the examiner must be able to clearly understand the graph only by reading your answer. Don’t make the examiner refer the graph and chart time and again.
       %%	Use collocations. A band 7 answer demands collocations.
       %%	Keep your handwriting clean and understandable. As long as your handwriting can be understood, there will not be problem.
       %%	Don’t use similar kind of sentence structures again and again.
       %%	It is advisable that you don’t repeat the same words again and again, show some lexical resource range. 
       %%	Keep your sentences grammatically correct.
       %%	Do not use jargons to make your answer look high-end, if you are not sure about the meaning of those words.

    title: 'HOW TO DESCRIBE A MAP?',
    id: 4,
    route: '/ielts-writing/topic/4-how-to-describe-a-map',
    description: `
    %%You are given a variety of maps in this kind of question.Although there are some technical differences, writing is almost identical to describing charts or tables.You need to focus on changes when describing maps, but graphs and tables don't have trends like that.Maps employ vocabulary that is distinct from that of tables and charts.Recently, the map question has been appearing more frequently on the IELTS test.The interesting thing is that, if you practice it well, you can get better marks than on the test for charts and tables, assuming you get one.Additionally, it is somewhat simpler.
  %%There are technically three different kinds of maps.*
  %% Give an example of a modern map.
  %% Describe two maps, one from the future and one from the present.
 %% Give two maps, one from the past and one from the present, a description.
  %%There are two kinds of maps that depict the natural world.
  %%Plan of a building, apartment, or shopping center; park or city map; In the first type of chart, only simple present can be used, making comparisons impossible.As a result, it comes very rarely.
 %% The second kind of map occasionally appears because it has two distinct time settings;You must use the same tenses in the present and future.Most of the time, these kinds of questions are about how the map looks now and how it will look in the future after redevelopment.The words you use are the same whether it's about a town or a city, which is common.
 %% Because the third type of map question is the most prevalent, we will concentrate primarily on it.You will be presented with two maps, and you will be required to select and report on the primary feature. As with other types of questions in this task 1, you will also be required to compare where necessary.To describe the town's development, you must use the past and present tenses to describe the changes.
 %% We will also employ the passive because this is a man-made procedure.
  %%The most important thing to know about this chapter is how to describe specific changes.You will not be able to provide a satisfactory response that will earn you a band 7 or higher if you are unable to adequately describe changes.The most important information in your response should be about how the town has changed over time. You should focus on open spaces, buildings, roads, bridges, natural vegetation, and other features and compare them to the previous map.
  %% *Tip:%%Almost certainly, you will be gotten some information about your old neighborhood in your talking test, so recall the vocabularies we learn in this part will come convenient.
  %%The following is a list of various buildings, features, and verbs that we could use to describe their alterations.
 %% Demolished, knocked-down, flattened, replaced, renovated, built, constructed, reconstructed, developed, extended, expanded, relocated, converted, and modernized buildings account for a percentage of all construction.
  %%Examples*:
  %%The government built a sports field and demolished the industrial estate.
  %%They replaced the shops with skyscrapers instead.
 %% At the river's mouth, a port was built.
  %%The factory in the center of the city was torn down and moved to the north of the city.
  %%New hotels took the place of the old warehouses.
  Apartments were constructed in place of the factory.
  %% Trees and Forests—cleared, chopped down, removed, planted.
 %% Examples*:
 %% A shopping center was built in its place after the forest was cleared out.
  The trees were cut down to make room for houses. %%
  %% Lines of roads, bridges, and railways that have been constructed, built, expanded, and removed.
  %%A new bridge over the river and an extension of the main road were constructed.
  %% Opened, established, and developed leisure facilities
 %% Examples*:
  %%The swimming pool was next to a skate park.
  %%A park was built next to the forest.
  %%In the overview section of this chapter, we discussed how to write generally about the major changes and values by selecting and then reporting. %% How to Describe General ChangesWe will need to write an overview because this is also a writing task 1 question on the IELTS test.We must examine the major differences between the two maps and write broadly about them when writing an overview.
  %%The following are some examples of general statements that we could use to describe urban change.
  The region underwent significant transformations during that time.
  From 1995 to 2005, the city center underwent remarkable transformations.
  %% Over time, the village underwent significant transformations.
 %% The industrial area underwent a complete transformation over the course of ten years.%%
 %% The residential area has been completely rebuilt over the past two decades.
 %% The outdated docks were completely redeveloped over the course of the period.
 %% The older homes were rebuilt between 1995 and 2005.
 %% During this time, the central business district underwent a complete transformation.
 %% You are free to select a few sentences to use in your overview paragraph from the various types of sentences that can be used to describe the changes listed above in the bullet points.In the second paragraph of your response, select two or three differences that stand out the most and generalize about them.
 %% Your main body paragraphs should contain the more specific changes.
%%  How to Describe Locations Another important skill that you must acquire is the ability to describe the location of the objects on the maps.Locations can be described using a variety of vocabularies.You might have been taught about the "Preposition of Place" in school;at, in, on, by, near, off, and from, to indicate where things are.By portraying area you will satisfy two prerequisites;You will be able to describe the changes that occurred and will also be able to point out the proper location on the map where the infrastructures are.
  %% You can use "to the left" and "to the right," but using "north," "south," "east," and "west" is better.If the symbols are not already on the question paper, I would suggest that you draw them there.
 %% Examples*:
 %% The forest to the south of the river was cleared to a percent.
  %%To the north of the airport, a golf course was built.
  %%The homes in the town's southwest corner were demolished at a rate of %.
  %%A park was built on the green fields to the north-west of the city.
  %%The airport, which was located in the city's center, was moved to the north-east of the river.
  %%A new school was constructed to the east of the forest instead of the one to the south-east.
  %%Lastly, you will be expected to use place prepositions. Some examples:
 %% The city center underwent significant transformations.
  %%A golf course that is surrounded by trees can be found to the south of the town.
  %%The swimming pool was located next to a brand-new school.
  %%A new motorway took the place of the old road that ran north to south.
 %% A marina was constructed on the river's banks.
 %% *Section 1: Structure for Map Description %%Paragraph 1: %%Sentence 1: Answer the question in the manner that you were instructed to do in this chapter's paraphrase section.In IELTS writing task 1, it is the same for all question types.
  %% Paragraph 2: %%Overview Select the most striking distinctions between the two maps and write two or three general statements about them.Have you ever played the game "find the difference," in which you had to identify five or six differences between two images?Being able to identify the difference is helpful in maps questions, but you must also describe in this case.
  %% The questions below will assist in locating the primary characteristics required to compose an appropriate response.
 %% What percentage of the map is residential?
 %% Is there more or less land available?
  Do more or fewer trees exist?
  %% Were the changes significant or insignificant?
  %%	Were there any significant enhancements in framework?
 %% How have the structures and recreational facilities changed?
 %% Write three to four sentences about specific changes that have taken place, drawing comparisons from the first group of information from the overview paragraph. %% Paragraph 3: %%Main Body 1: Sentence 1
  %%Paragraph 4: Main Body 2 %% Sentence 1: Write three to four more sentences about specific changes from the second group of information in the overview paragraph.
  %% *TIP:%%You can assemble data in passage 3 and 4 by time or area, contingent upon the inquiry posed.
 %% *Sample Response %%The two maps shown below depict an island prior to and following the construction of some tourist facilities.
 %% Select and report the most important aspects of the data to provide a summary, and where appropriate, make comparisons.
 %% Write a minimum of 150 words.

 %% Both maps show an island before and after it was made into a tourist destination.
 %% The island is approximately 100 meters long, has a beach to the west, is dotted with palm trees, and is surrounded by water.The island underwent a complete transformation over the course of time, with the addition of a hotel and a pier;However, it appears that the eastern portion of the island has not been developed.
 %% The hotel rooms are the most obvious addition.Six buildings have been built in the west of the island, surrounding some trees, and nine buildings have been built in the center of the island.A restaurant and a reception building have been constructed in the space in between the two accommodation areas.
 %% Yachts now have access to the resort thanks to the construction of a pier on the island's south coast.The beach is the only natural feature that hasn't changed much, other than the trees;However, it does appear that swimming is now its primary use.

    title: 'HOW TO DESCRIBE PROCESS DIAGRAM / FLOW CHART',
    route: '/ielts-writing/topic/5-how-to-describe-process-diagram-flow-chart',
    description: `
    %%HOW ARE PROCESS QUESTIONS DEFINED?*
    %%The process question, as the name suggests, requires you to describe a process.A process question uses different vocabulary than a chart or map question.In contrast to the place prepositions used in map questions, you will need to use time prepositions in this.In terms of nature, there are two kinds of process questions.First is the man-made process where you will be approached to depict the most common way of making concrete, blocks, espresso or tea, hydropower age, etc.The second is the natural process, in which you will be asked questions about natural phenomena like;a frog's or a butterfly's life cycle, pregnancy, how a dog makes milk, how humans digest food, etc.Don't look confused, then!The same structure is involved in describing both types.However, there are two additional types in terms of technicality: the linear process and the circular process.
    %%*A few of the vocabulary that can be useful for describing a process diagram.
   %% You can use useful connecting words like:
   %% The Adverbs*
   %%• first, first of all, or The first step | is involved + V-ing | when + Clause %%• second, thirdly %%• then/next/after that/following on from this,... %%• subsequent/in the subsequent stage/following on from that, finally
    %%The prepositionsUse the conjunctions "at the beginning of" and "at the end of" to create more complex sentences:
   %%• When, once, immediately, or while....
   %%• before + clause or gerund %%• after + clause or gerund %%• where/from where/after which %%• and then + clause Take some time to comprehend the question and come up with a strategy.Since it is a process question, each step is linked to the next;Consequently, you must describe each phase.Your response becomes uninteresting if you only describe the phases or steps.The vocabulary you use to describe the sequence is the most important factor here.You must follow the steps below to respond to a process question.
   %% 1.Understanding the procedure is, of course, the first step.Examples include how many steps there are, where it begins and ends, how it relates to the steps before and after it, and most importantly, whether it is a man-made, natural, linear, or cyclical process.
   %% 2.It's time to paraphrase once you understand the procedure.The method for paraphrasing is the same for every kind of question.
   %% 3.The time has come to write an overview after this.As we have previously discussed, employ the same or similar method.Describe the general scenario, the number of stages, and whether the process is cyclical or linear.There should be two or three sentences in your overview paragraph.Don't forget to divide the data into two groups.
   %% 4.Write the detail paragraph by making use of the collection of information.
   %% 5.Finally, you must proofread your work for errors in sequence, grammar, and spelling.
   %% Getting a Good Understanding of the Process*%% One thing to keep in mind when answering questions of this kind is that you might see a diagram that you have never seen before.Relax; the examiner is aware of that as well.Simply select a few of the most important features and describe them.In most cases, a process question requires that each step be explained in relation to other steps.While analyzing the process, you can ask yourself these questions to gain an understanding of the procedure.
   %%• When does the process begin and end?
   %%• How many stages, phases, and steps are there?
   %%• Is it a cyclical or linear process—man-made or natural?
   %%• Is it a manufacturing procedure?Check to see if any materials need to be added.
   %%• Take note of the final product.
   %%• What is each stage's significance?
   %%• How are the stages connected to one another?
   %%• The Question%% All of the questions in Writing Task 1 follow a similar format.For instance, they first provide you with general information before pointing you in the right direction.In other questions, you'll see words like "map" and "chart," but in this one, you'll see "diagram," and you can write its synonym.Illustration is a possible synonym.
   %%  An Overview of the Process*%% As previously mentioned, an overview paragraph is a general description of a chart, map, table, or diagram.Therefore, you can simply write about how well you understand the diagram in general in this process question by asking the questions listed in the "Understanding the Process" section.Keep in mind, we have definitely realized that an outline passage is the spine your composing task 1 so make it alluring, straightforward and reasonable and furthermore recollect not to utilize any type of information.For instance, writing "in the first stage 10% sand and 20% water is mixed" mentions the data, whereas writing "there are 4 stages in the diagram" does not.This can be done in the section on details.Therefore, maintain your composure and compose an overview.
   %% Describe in detail each stage of the process (the first group of information in the first paragraph, the second group in the second) Now that we have completed the overview and the paraphrase, it is time to write the detail paragraph.We are required to report the main features and make comparisons in this paragraph because the question asks us to do so.
   %% You could:*
   %%• Explain what each stage does, what it produces, if any materials are added, and/or how it relates to the stages that came before or after it.
   %%  Review Your Essay You ought to be finished in 16 to 17 minutes.Check for grammatical (tense, sub-verb agreement), spelling, punctuation, word count, and vocabulary repetition in three to four minutes.
    %% *Example Response %%The process of making bricks for the construction industry is depicted in the diagram.
   %% Select and report the most important aspects of the information to provide a summary, and make any necessary comparisons.

   %% The illustration depicts the steps that go into making bricks for the construction industry.
   %% In total, seven stages can be clearly seen, beginning with the collection of the raw material, clay, and ending with the delivery of the bricks.
   %% After an excavator is used to dig up the clay needed to make bricks, production begins.The purchased clay is then spread out on the metal grid above the roller.The clay is then mixed with water, sand, and the right amount of sand.The mixture is either put into a separate mold to make one brick at a time, or it is put into a frame to make a flat, thin product that is then cut with a wire to make bricks.
  %%  After that, the bricks are dried in an oven for one to two days.Consequently, they are first warmed in an oven at a moderate temperature of 200 degree - 980 degree Celsius before they are moved to be warmed at a high temperature of 870 - 1300 degree Celsius.After that, the bricks are cooled for 48 to 72 hours.The bricks are then packed and transported to their final location by trucks.

    id: 6,
    description: `
   %% Questions involving multiple graphs are the most prevalent type.You will be asked to choose between two different kinds of tables or charts in this kind of question.It is similar to describing other types of questions to describe this one.However, there are some technical differences and a few typical issues that students encounter when presented with this kind of question, which are outlined below along with possible solutions.
 %%   %%• Writing too much—As you know, you only have 20 minutes to respond to the writing task 1 question. If you write too much or include everything you see, you may not finish your response in time, which will result in a loss of score.In addition, the instruction makes it abundantly clear that you are required to select the most important aspects and write about them; however, if you write about everything, this indicates that you have not followed the instruction and that you have not responded appropriately to the question.
   %% To take care of the above issue you should just pick just most significant component, 2 from each diagram and expound Just On THEM.Because the examiner is also evaluating your ability to differentiate between significant and nonsignificant features, you do not need to be concerned about leaving out features that are not important.This will help you demonstrate your ability to summarize.
   %%• What about not being able to locate the primary characteristics?You only need to locate the two primary features that are most clearly visible in the graph, as we discussed in the preceding paragraph.That is to say, anyone must be able to demonstrate the difference without looking at the data.Find the highest and lowest values, the trend's increase or decrease, notable exceptions, and similarities.In my experience, this is a situation in which students feel extremely insecure and include less obvious data in their responses. However, examiners are only looking for obvious data that also serve as the main features.
  %%  %%• Another big mistake that a lot of students make is not grouping the information together and just writing whatever comes to mind, similar to the stream-of-consciousness literary technique.If you do this, you will probably get lost and your answer will be a mess.To solve this issue, the first thing you need to do is devise a strategy and devote some time to planning the content of each paragraph.Writing about one graph in one paragraph and another in the next is the easiest way to accomplish this.Depending on the question, you can make comparisons in the second paragraph.
   %%• Don't be arrogant when comparing data from any source to any other when doing so.Many students squander a lot of time looking for comparison points, but the key is to read the instructions carefully.It makes it abundantly clear that, when "relevant," students must make comparisons.There is nothing to compare in some questions, so you are not required to make comparisons.However, there may be data that can be compared between the two graphs but not between them.You should be absolutely cautious here as it will save you time and checks.
   %% Moving on to THE STRUCTURE, let's look at the first paragraph. %%• The first sentence is a set of question sentences.
   %% When paraphrasing, you should combine the sentences using "and" or "while" to produce a complex sentence because there is a marking criteria called "grammar range and accuracy." As a result, you will earn points for the aforementioned marking criteria.
    %%• Sentence 1: An overview of two of the primary characteristics of graph number 1
    %%• Second sentence: An overview of two of the most important characteristics of graph 2.
   %%• Third sentence: An overview of any necessary comparisons (optional).
   %%• Sentence 1: Information about the first main feature of graph number 1 %%• Sentence 2: Information about the second main feature of graph number 1
   %% Section 7 provides specifics regarding the first main feature of graph number 2.
   %%• Details of the second main feature of graph number 2 in sentence 8
   %%• Details of any comparisons (if any) in sentence 9
  %% A Sample Response*
  %% The primary reasons why agricultural land becomes less productive are depicted in the pie chart below.Three regions of the globe were impacted by these causes in the 1990s, as shown in the table.
  %%  Choose and report the most important aspects of the information to summarize it, and where appropriate, make comparisons.
  %%https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/akielts-web.appspot.com/o/writing%2F65.jpg?alt=media&token=418d207d-a18d-44ee-b4e8-ed5c33bceaf4
  %%  Answer
  %% The data for three regions of the world that were impacted by these factors in the 1990s are displayed in the table, while the pie graph depicts the primary factors that resulted in farming land becoming less fertile.
 %%   [While paraphrasing, I have only substituted synonyms for some words, such as "show," "reasons," "agricultural," "productive," and "world," and I have added the words "while" to these two sentences to create a complex sentence.In addition, I have altered the word order in the second question sentence.]
 %%  Overgrazing is the primary factor contributing to the overall deterioration of farmland, as can be seen clearly in the pie chart.The table shows that North America had the least degraded farmland, while Europe had the most, followed by Oceania.
  %%  [If you noticed, I only selected the most obvious features from the table and pie chart in this section and generally wrote about them without including any numbers or data.Additionally, since neither the pie chart nor the table contain a date, 1990, I used the simple present tense for both.]
  %%  To begin, the pie chart depicts four causes, with overgrazing accounting for just over a third of the total.Broad chopping down of trees and the over-utilization of harvests include almost 33% and a little more than a quarter individually.
   %% [In this instance, I have varied my language by utilizing synonyms for the causes and proportions and fractions for the data; however, I have omitted the additional reason because the data is of insignificant importance.]
   %% Then again, assuming we take a gander at the table, we can see that 23% of Europe's complete land was corrupted however just a little extent (5%) of cultivable place that is known for North America succumbed.Oceania lost only 13% of its total land productivity.As a matter of fact, no land was hurt because of over development and significant reason for land being barren was over brushing in Oceania in 1990s.
   %% [Here, I've focused on the totals, but as you can see, Oceania had a notable exception, so I talked about it. Other details about other regions weren't as important, so I didn't include them.Additionally, I have altered the terminology for "land not being productive."]

%% FIVE Moves toward Compose A GENERAL Preparation LETTER*
%%*Comprehend how the test is stamped.
%%Please refer to the initial pages for the marking criteria for this.
%% *Choose whether the letter should be formal or casual.
%%You are required to respond in the form of an informal letter if you are asked to write to someone you know.On the other hand, you are required to respond in the form of a formal letter if you are asked to write to someone you do not know.
%% *Discuss each of the question's bullet points.
%%You will be given bullet points at which you can ask questions.As a result, you ought to compose a paragraph for each bullet point.
%% *At last, sign your letter.
%%Don't make things too complicated to end.Simply sign off as you did in the letter and write your name below.
%% *Go over your work.
%%Check to see that there are no grammatical or vocabulary errors in your letter.
%% *IMPORTANT NOTES %% When writing an IELTS general training letter, you should not include the date or the address like you would in a standard letter.
%% Your thoughts ought to be organized into paragraphs.You will see bullet points in the question where you will be asked a few questions.For a question, you should write a paragraph.
%% Your letter should consist of four paragraphs.The first one explains why you are writing the letter, and the remaining three are each for bullet points.
%% You should not copy words from the question because doing so amounts to plagiarism—which is a form of intellectual theft—and is against the law.Actually, those are the examiner's words, not yours.As a result, you ought to paraphrase.
%% We Nepalese students are instructed at the school level to sign off with our name on the right side of the letter.However, finishing your letter on the right side is common practice in the United Kingdom and other nations.Since we will be writing our IELTS essays, why not use the British or Australian salutation?
%% Your signature is not required.For informal letters, simply write your name, while for formal ones, write your first and last names.
%% The purpose of your letter must be stated clearly in the first paragraph.
%% When writing anything, including an IELTS letter, there must always be a plan.
%% Your tone in the letter should be either informal or formal, depending on the tone of the letter.
%% Your letter must be structured in a way that makes it easy to understand, and the ideas conveyed must be coherent.

%%*TASK 1 %%LETTER WRITING TIPS*
%% *Creating a plan is always beneficial %%Many students claim that if they use their limited-time plan, they will not have enough time.They say that planning will take five to ten minutes, but if you plan, you can finish your work in six to eight minutes, and you won't have to spend as much time checking it.Students who earn a band 7 or higher prepare their responses in advance.Don't forget to state the purpose of your letter before covering the three bullet points.The question will provide you with the concept for it.
%%The fundamental structure that will assist you in planning your letter is provided below.
%%Dear X: %%Paragraph 1: State the purpose of your letter; %%Paragraph 2: State the first bullet point;%% Paragraph 3: State the second bullet point; %%Paragraph 4: State the third bullet point.
%%Ending with (sincere regards, best wishes, etc.)
%%Your Name The format shouldn't change, and the only things you'll need to think about are using the right style, accomplishing the letter's purpose, and filling in the details.
%% *Writing in the correct style increases your score.
%%Your writing style needs to be tailored to the type of letter—formal, semi-formal, or informal—that you are writing for.You must read the question and try to understand it in order to differentiate between these three types of letters.It is informal if the question asks you to write the letter to a friend.It is semi-formal if you are asked to write to a coworker, and formal if you are asked to write to someone you do not personally know.
%%The tone of a letter of application or complaint cannot be informal if you do not know the person's first and last names.However, since we do not need to be formal with the people we know, the tone of the letter must be much more laid-back if you know them well.However, Semi-formal is the sort of letter that befuddles the understudies.The question asks you to write a letter to a coworker; however, knowing that the person in question is not a friend or even a stranger causes confusion.Imagine writing a letter to a boss who is nice to you but whom you must still respect.If you are in this situation, you should speak in a semiformal manner because using an informal tone may come across as disrespectful, while using a totally formal tone may come across as a little cold.
%%We will take a gander at the different language structure and jargon you ought to use for each way of composing beneath.
%% Answer each and every question.*%% Each question has three bullet points.Answer all of the bullet points, but you must answer each one in three separate paragraphs.Always remember to respond to the bullet points with at least two sentences per point.Write five sentences for each paragraph at the very least.
%% Use Complex Sentences to Improve Your Grammar We've always talked about how important complex sentences are.It will without a doubt raise your score.It is essential that you do not make any grammatical errors.
%% You must know which tense to use If you are asked to write about an experience you have had in the past, such as why you changed jobs or how you recently went to a zoo, you should use the past tense.Similarly, you should use the present tense when describing your relationship with your family or your new job.You should use the future tense whenever you are asked to write about your plans for the future or what you will be doing for the upcoming holiday.
%% Write Your Letter Correctly* %%There are many different ways to begin and end your letter, but the following are some that you should always use.
%% *Formal, whose name you are unfamiliar with:
%%Dear Sir/Madam, Yours sincerely %% *Formal, and you are familiar with the name:
%%Mr. or Mrs.Family Name] Sincerely, my dear %% *Semi-Formal:
%%Kind regards, [First Name] %% *Informal:
%%Dear [First Name], Best Regards %% *Exceed the Word Limit%% Yes, you are absolutely correct that there is a word limit of 150 words, and you are also aware that it is at least 150 words.However, believe me when I say that the examiners are paid to count every word you write, so don't think you can get away with writing less than 150 words.Therefore, write more than 150 words just to be safe.Writing up to 190 words is acceptable.
%% Adhere to the 100 percent Rule*%% The IELTS does not expect you to write a letter that is very difficult to comprehend; rather, it expects you to write a letter with a clear progression, a lot of unusual vocabulary that is used naturally and correctly, and complex sentences.However, you should not display pride and assume that your writing will be accurate.When you're done writing, go over your work.Make absolutely certain that you are aware of the words' meanings and that the grammar is correct.
%% Avoid being overly formal *%%If you are writing an informal letter, you cannot use Facebook language like "u" for "you," "coz" for "because," "LOL," "ROFL," "OMG," or any slang words or emoticons like "," "." %% Avoid being overly dramatic* %%You are not required to be overly dramatic in order to impress or amaze the examiner.While it is true that you will need to imagine a story in order to answer the question, you do not have to be overly dramatic when writing one.Simply maintain relevance and simplicity.
%%*Examples of formal letters include the following: %%• I am writing this letter with regard to... %%• I am writing to bring to your attention... %%• I am writing to inform you that... %%• I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with...... Requests and Suggestions %%• I would be grateful if you would... %%• I would like you to... %%• I am entitled to request that you....
%%• I was curious if it was at all feasible to....

%%Ending:%% I am eager to hear from you.
%%• I am eagerly awaiting your response.
%%• I expect prompt service from you.
%%• I appreciate your consideration.
%%• Kindly respond as soon as possible.
%%You recently went on vacation and lost a valuable item.You are fortunate to have travel insurance that will cover any losses.
%%Send a letter to the insurance company manager.Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to inform you that I recently lost my digital camera while on vacation in Indonesia. In your letter, you should: %%• describe the item you lost; %%• explain how you lost it; and %%• tell the insurance company what you would like them to do.
%%When I bought it new last month, it was a black Canon 70d that cost $1550.It was housed in a brown leather case with my name on it, has a resolution of 20 megapixels, and has a 67 millimeter Canon lens.
%%While having coffee with my husband in Bali City's backpacker neighborhood, I misplaced it.The coffee shop, which I believe was on Great Walking Street, was called Highlands Coffee.When I noticed it was gone, we had been at the coffee shop for about 45 minutes.

%%Because it was no longer that much of a challenge, being a brain surgeon made me really sick of it.You know me;I get too easily bored if I don't learn new skills, so I have to find something new.
%%I absolutely love my job teaching English as a foreign language in Nepal.It is both challenging and rewarding for me to teach two adult classes and a kindergarten class.Could you at any point trust it?
%%I will also be getting married, which is an amazing development.I suppose it was love at first sight for us both because she was one of my first students.Make sure the first weekend in July is free so you can join us for the celebration.

    description: `
   %% In writing task 2 of the IELTS, we will go over a variety of essay types one by one in this chapter.With a small difference, writing task 2 is basically the same for academic training and general training.We'll go over the differences below.
    %%Basic Similarities and Distinctions Between Academic and General Training *%%Writing Tasks 2*%% 1.DIFFICULTY*%% The primary distinction is the level of difficulty.The questions are relatively easier to answer due to their subject matter and format.In contrast to academic topics like habits and space exploration, questions are easier to understand and essay topics like family, society, television, schools, and communication are more common.However, practicing with a variety of questions is beneficial for GT candidates.%%2.ESSAY TYPES The essay formats for the two examinations are comparable.There is a good chance that you will write an opinion essay, a discussion essay, an advantage/disadvantage essay, a problem-solving essay, or a direct question essay.
   %% 3. MARKING AND SCORING *%%The band score is the same for both types of tests, but the marking criteria are slightly different.
   %% 4.ESSAY WRITING STYLE*%% The essay writing format, structure, and method are the same for both types of tests.
   %% 5. LENGTH AND TIME OF THE ESSAY*%% In both academic and general essays, a candidate must write more than 250 words in 40 minutes.
   %% You should never overlook any of these seven essential aspects.
   %% 1. Responding to a question %%2. Developing a thesis statement %%3. Producing topic sentences %%4. Detailing the topic sentenceExamplesConclusion:%%Your score is also significantly influenced by the language you choose.A number of useful signpost languages are listed below.
    %%By way of illustration:*
    %% For instance, %% In this case, %% In particular, %% Notably,%% *Adding additional details:
    %% Also, %% Also, %% Also, %% Again, %% In other words, %% In other words, %% In detail, Suggesting a result:

    %%To begin, %% In the first instance, %% To continue, %% *To conclude, %% *To summarize, %% To conclude, %%*HOW DO YOU CHOOSE AN OPINION FOR ANY ESSAY?
  %%In an opinion question, your opinion is most important.You have to say something if you want to get away.That is to say, it is necessary to voice one's opinion.Nonetheless, coming to a choice is a tiring interaction.When you see the question, students frequently assume that they agree with it, but when asked to provide two reasons for their understanding, they are unable to come up with the second one, which causes a creative lull and leaves them stuck, similar to a conflict. Sometimes, it is so precarious that you may lose a lot of time before you finish your point of view.Therefore, it is essential that you move on to disagreement if you are unable to provide two reasons for disagreement and vice versa.You will be tested on your English, not your principles.The medal for your principles is not your primary goal here; rather, you should aim for a high band score as much as possible.Avoiding adherence to your convictions is preferable.
   %% Because the total time allotted for writing task 2 questions is 40 minutes, the examiner expects you to make a decision about your opinion within the first three minutes.Planning is required when coming to a decision.So, how are you going to come to a conclusion? It's simple: let's plan first.You are free to scribble on as many papers as you like, so how do we prepare?Use one of those documents to make a plan.Although the outcome will surprise you, you might be thinking, "If I make a plan, it will take a lot of time and I won't be able to finish my work on time."You will complete your work on time if you have a strategy.With a plan, it becomes quick and easy.
    Let's look at an illustration to better understand.
   %% Think about the following scenario:As a result of consuming an excessive amount of fast food, an increasing number of people are experiencing health issues in some nations."Subsequently, legislatures should charge a higher duty on this sort of food.
    How much do you agree with or disagree with?
  %%You will be asked to respond with an affirmative or negative response to the question's scenario.The first steps are to plan your response and fully comprehend the question.But first, you have to decide whether you agree or disagree.Let's investigate that further.
  %%In the previous question, let's say you agree that the government should tax fast food. %%MAKE A PLANNING/IDEA GENERATIONHowever, it is not sufficient to simply agree.We are aware that our agreement must be based on two factors.Therefore, try writing two points to demonstrate your agreement.However, remember that you cannot be vague;You must be precise.
    because obese customers of fast food restaurants stand to gain from the tax revenue.
  %%  Why not fast food, given that it has the same negative effects as alcohol?*
    %%III) When fast food prices go up, people eat less of it, which is good for public health.
    Try disagreeing right now.Let's say you say, "The government should not levy taxes on the fast food" because so many busy people rely on fast food. I).
    %%II) As a result of the prevalence of fast food culture among adolescents—two thirds of the population—%%III) As a result of taxation, which drives up the cost of fast food and leads to the failure of many businesses.
    I have provided three reasons for each to help you decide whether you agree or disagree.However, I believe that the benefits of agreement outweigh the disadvantages.Consequently, I have decided to adhere to the agreement and have developed convincing arguments and a plan for my essay.Because of the two best reasons, I'll stick with it.I meant to say that even though I disagree with the statement in the question, I didn't mention it because I couldn't think of a good reason to disagree.You should follow suit;Change rather than sticking to your principles if you can.`

   %% The question is always paraphrased in the first sentence of this paragraph.Follow the same method that you learned to paraphrase the question in the first section of writing task 1.
   %% The thesis statement is the second sentence that answers the question "do you agree or disagree."If you only partially agree and only partially disagree, your response will be incoherent and confusing because you will be confused while expressing your opinion. As a result, you must either agree or disagree.To maintain order and simplicity, either agree or disagree.
   %% The third sentence is where you introduce your response briefly.The outline sentence is it.In order for the examiner to make up their mind regarding your subsequent response, you will be required to provide two reasons for your agreement or disagreement in this section.In the subsequent two paragraphs, you will use this outline sentence to present your opinion in a more elucidative manner.
    %%Paragraph* 2 %%You are required to write at least four sentences in this paragraph.
   %% Your topic sentence will be in the first sentence.The essay's introduction paragraph and topic sentence are similar.Point sentence simply presents your section.Therefore, writing a topic sentence informs the examiner about your first body paragraph, also known as a supporting paragraph.The first sentence of your outline sentence, which you wrote in the opening paragraph, is the topic sentence.Simply write down your first point from the outline sentence.
  %%  The explanation for your topic sentence will be in the second and third sentences.Asking yourself, "Why do I agree or disagree to the first statement that I made in agreement or disagreement?" is the easiest way to comprehend this.Confused?We'll investigate it in the sample response.
  %%  The fourth sentence is where you provide an appropriate and logical example to support your explanation.In point of fact, it is not necessary for your example to be true; it could be a fiction, but it must be logically related to the previous explanation.The IELTS does not have a lie detector.
    %%Paragraph* 3 %% In this paragraph, you should choose the second point of the outline sentence and proceed in the same manner as in paragraph 2.Maintain the same structure.
   %% The concluding paragraph, paragraph 4, is significant.It is a synopsis of what you said in paragraphs 2 and 3.A brilliant agree or disagree essay can be written by simply summarizing the points in two or three sentences.
    %%NOTE:When writing your response, don't come up with new ideas.Stay true to your original concepts in your outline sentences.The format is the same for a question about a positive or negative development; however, you only need to answer the question, "Why do you think it is a positive or negative development?"You will be required to provide two justifications for either viewpoint.
  %%  A growing number of people in some countries are experiencing health issues as a result of overindulging in fast food.As a result, governments must charge a higher tax on this kind of food.
  %%  How much do you concur or disagree?
   %% Because there are more health risks associated with eating junk food, it is argued that governments should impose a tariff on it.This essay agrees that fast-food businesses should pay a higher tax rate.First, alcohol and tobacco companies already have to pay more taxes. Second, more taxes could make things more expensive and make people less likely to drink.
    %%[Refer to the first sentence;] %%It is merely the question's paraphrase.The thesis statement can be found in the second sentence, which serves as the response to the question.The introduction to your body paragraphs is the third sentence.The language that brightens up your sentences is represented by the underlined words, which are also referred to as the signpost words.]
   %% It has been demonstrated that raising taxes on cigarettes and liqueur is effective in reducing the harm caused by these products.To put it another way, this money has been used to treat health issues caused by these products and to fund advertising campaigns that warn people about the dangers of using alcohol and tobacco.The same strategy could be applied to fast food taxes.One prime example is the United Kingdom, where money from smokers is used to treat heart disease and lung cancer.
   %% [Here, the topic sentence serves as an overview of the second paragraph.The extended version of the first outline sentence is the first sentence.The explanation of the topic sentence in the second and third sentences addresses the questions "why" and "how," and the example in the fourth sentence is logically consistent with both the explanation and the topic sentence.In addition, the words that are highlighted serve as a guide.]
   %% In a similar vein, raising taxes would result in decreased consumption and increased prices.That is to say, fast food restaurants would pass on these taxes to customers in the form of higher prices, which would make junk food too expensive for most people.As a result, junk food would soon become a luxury item that was only eaten occasionally, which would be better for people's health.For instance, the majority of people find the cost of organic food to be prohibitive, so only a small percentage of people regularly purchase it.
    %%[Here, the topic sentence is used in the first sentence with a slight modification.The explanation to the question "why and how" can be found in the second and third sentences, while the example can be found in the third.The words that have been highlighted act as a guide once more.]In conclusion, junk food should be taxed at a higher rate because alcohol and tobacco set a good example, and because the higher price should make people buy less fast food.
   %% [The main points of paragraphs 2 and 3 are summarized and reiterated in this concluding paragraph.]

    description: `
  %%  This is also a question of opinion, but it does not ask whether you agree or disagree;Instead, this kind of question will require you to discuss both sides and offer your perspective.Yes, it appears straightforward, but you are mistaken to believe it is straightforward.Although the question appears straightforward, your response contains a tricky part.For the time being, keep things on the edge.We'll look into it later.Before that, you need to be aware that the format and approach you used to practice the agree/disagree question are not suitable for this circumstance.The funny thing is that you'll have to argue with yourself and act like the opposing side.It is comparable to playing chess with oneself.
  %%  You will begin by rephrasing the question in the first sentence.%% STRUCTRE FOR THE ANSWER%%Paragraph* 1 (Introduction)%%In the second sentence, you will merely state both points of view; this is also the thesis statement for your essay.Simply state your opinion in the third sentence if asked to do so;This serves as the opening sentence of your essay.
  %%  Second paragraph of the body:You will also use a topic sentence to begin this paragraph.The topic sentence is not simply a paraphrase of your position in this instance;Instead, you'll need to make it abundantly clear why your point of view is superior, make a compelling case right away, and imply that you do so.After that, you'll either add supporting information to your topic sentence or explain it.Keep in mind that you are supporting and defending one of the viewpoints presented in this paragraph.Actually, write first about the candidate you support.The paragraph will then be concluded with a logically connected example.
   %% The second body paragraph, paragraph 3, also begins with a topic sentence; however, the topic sentence is more than just the outline sentence.Write down what the opponent would say in this sentence as the topic sentence right away.In contrast to paragraph 2, you will present the opposing viewpoint from the question.You will momentarily make sense of it in a solitary sentence.However, after that, the challenging part begins.In the third sentence, you must demonstrate that the individuals who disagree with your supported viewpoint may be partially correct, but that your supported viewpoint also carries the possibility of implying what they want (for clarity, see the sample response below).
    %%Paragraph* 4 (Conclusion) %%In this paragraph, you will use a complex sentence to summarize your argument from paragraphs 2 and 3, and you will simply state which viewpoint is superior or your opinion in the second sentence.
   %% SAMPLE ANSWER %% The use of computers in education is on the rise.While others contend that it is having a negative impact, some assert that this is a trend in the right direction.
    %%Talk about the two sides of the contention prior to offering your own viewpoint.
    %%The utilization of tablets and laptops in the classroom is on the rise.Some people argue that this is a positive development, while others disagree and think it will be detrimental.This essay agrees that technological advancements are beneficial to educators and students.
    %%The internet clearly provides students with access to more information than ever before.In addition, students can learn about and conduct research on any subject by simply clicking a button.As a result, everyone agrees that technology is a very useful tool for education.Wikipedia is a prime example, where students can quickly and easily enter any keyword to access in-depth information.
   %% However, a lot of people disagree and believe that genuine human interaction is no longer necessary thanks to technology.Through human interaction, valuable skills like discourse, debate, and empathy can be learned.Despite this, the internet still lets people talk to each other, and this essay disagrees that technology should be discounted because of this.Facebook and Skype, for example, make it possible for people to communicate in ways that were previously unimaginable.
    %%In conclusion, despite the benefits of technology, particularly the internet, which provide students with access to numerous informational resources, there are still those who argue that people ought to be wary of this new phenomenon and prevent it from reducing face-to-face interaction.However, as long as we pay close attention to the significance of human interaction in education, the educational benefits are clearly positive.`

    title: 'PROBLEM/CAUSE AND SOLUTION',
    id: '11',
    route: '/ielts-writing/topic/11-problem-cause-and-solution',
    description: `
  %%  Understanding the type of essay*%% This is a common type of essay on the IELTS academic tests.Even though this is a simple type of essay, many students struggle to get good grades because they don't have enough ideas.You are only required to list one or two issues and provide one or two solutions to those issues in response to this question.On the other hand, you might also get a cause-and-effect question.One kind of question tells you about a problem and asks you to write about what caused it, while the other type asks you to write about what caused the problem.In point of fact, you are required to compose a response for both types of questions.However, the examiner does not give you marks based on how well you have presented one or two problems, suggested one or two viable solutions, and expanded them well with appropriate examples. This is the most foolish thing that students do because the examiner does not give you marks based on how many problems or solutions you give.
  %%  Many students are so lost in thought that they come up with a lot of problems but can't come up with a solution;They are unable to link the solution to the issues.You should be exceptionally cautious while expressing the issues since you should interface them with the arrangements later on.You can't just say any problem that comes to mind, even if they are real, because you have to be able to come up with a real solution.Both the issues you identify and the solutions you propose must be real.Here, you are dealing with actual issues.In addition, you will receive a band 5 grade if you do not provide examples to back up your claims and expand on the issues you raise in your response.If you understand it, this question is simple, if not the most difficult, and it can earn you marks without your knowledge.That is to say, you will arrive happy, but when you see your scores, you will be depressed, surprised, and enraged.
  %%  I hope that all of you are familiar with the mobile game PUB-G or are already fans of it.Using an AK-47 to attempt to hit a target two kilometers away is analogous to writing about problems, causes, and solutions that are unrelated to the question.Isn't it obvious that you won't be able to attend it?In a similar vein, you should frame your response as if you were firing an 8X scoped KAR 98 and hitting your opponent half a kilometer away.I hope you understood.In a nutshell, your response needs to be extremely direct;omit discussing the larger issues.If you carefully examine the major and micro keywords, you will be able to hit the target.
  %%  What exactly are the micro and macro keywords now?*%%The question's macro keyword is the overall situation, while the micro keyword is the subject with which you must connect your points.In a similar vein, another keyword must be considered.It's the most important thing you need to do.Specifically, what are you expected to write?a problem or a cause with a remedy?You need to be careful here.If you are required to write about the problem, you must do so and provide a solution; however, if you write about the cause, you will lose marks, and vice versa.
    %%We should take a gander at a model, "An Earth-wide temperature boost is perhaps of the greatest danger people face in the 21st Hundred years and ocean levels are proceeding to increase at disturbing rates.What issues are associated with this and what potential solutions might there be?
   %% The bold word in this sample question is the macro keyword; however, you are not required to discuss the issues associated with it; consequently, if you discuss issues such as landslides, animal extinction, or flooding, you will not receive any points because you did not respond to the question in any way.Now take a look at the words that are highlighted; these are the micro keywords.Because "global warming" is the overarching concept that is associated with the issues "faced by humans" as a result of "sea level rise," you should think about expanding on the words above that have been highlighted.You should focus on the greatest threats that humans face as a result of sea level rise rather than the greatest threats that humans face as a result of global warming in this situation.You might be wondering, "Why can't I write about it when sea level rise is also the problem caused by global warming?"You are absolutely correct.Simply put, you are required to write about the issues brought on by rising sea levels.The comparison between hitting the target with an AK 47 and a KAR 98 can be seen here.If you write about the issues caused by sea level rise—the micro topic—you are hitting your target with a KAR 98, whereas if you write about the issues caused by global warming—the general topic—you are shooting at a target two kilometers away.This method works for any kind of task 2 question.
   %% Now that you know how to analyze the question, you shouldn't think of ideas that are relevant and to the point that are associated with the question.You are not required to write the points that you believe will win you the Nobel Prize in order to accomplish this, but writing a single, straightforward point will help you achieve high scores.To put it another way, don't be Nicolas Tesla and come up with brilliant ideas; leave that to him.Be yourself and act like you're just talking to a friend in a Santosh Uncle tea shop. That means you should think of a simple problem or cause that you can confidently solve (depending on the question).If you do this, you won't have any trouble coming up with two or three problems and possible solutions. It will also take you out into a more relaxed setting, which will help you relax your mind and make it easier to answer the question.
  %% How about actually coming up with ideas?*
  %%  Let's take the aforementioned question about global warming and try to come up with some ideas for possible issues and solutions that could be brought about by rising sea levels, which has a devastating impact on humans today.
    %%First of all, if you are asked about the problem or its cause, think immediately about the solution so that you can determine whether you know the solution or not, as shown below.
    %%Problem:flooding of individuals' homes and businesseseither construct flood barriers or relocate to higher elevations.starvation and the loss of agricultural land%%Solution:switch to crops that are better suitedMillions of people are being displaced; the solution:Before the floods, move people in a planned and organized manner. Problem:Unusable percent of groundwater Solution:construct desalination plants As can be seen, neither the problem nor the solution outlined above are particularly exceptional or exceptional at all.They are the logical next step for any normal person when they hear the phrase "sea level rise."After that, you shouldn't write about everything you thought of; instead, choose one or two problems and solutions based on what is asked of you;problem or problems, solution or solutions, but keep in mind that you must clearly understand that you can either expand on it and provide an example or leave it out and choose the next topic in which you are confident.
   %% Paragraph 1: %%Introduction%% In this paragraph, you present your essay to the examiner.The examiner will analyze your introduction to form an overall impression of your essay.It should be noted that there is no thesis statement in this introduction.This is because we are not asked to provide our opinion in this particular question.However, you should include a thesis statement in response to any IELTS problem-solving questions that ask for your opinion.
   %% First Sentence:%%You will only paraphrase the question in this sentence as usual.
  %% Second Sentence:%%The outline sentence is as follows:%%It will inform the examiner of the paragraphs they will read next.You will only discuss one or two issues and one or more potential solutions in this section.
  %%  A sample sentence:Sea level is rising at an alarming rate as a result of the rise in global temperature, which has made it one of the greatest fears of human civilization in the modern era.The flooding of homes is the main issue in this situation, and the best solution might be to build barricades along the shore.
    %%Sentence 1: The first sentence of the body paragraph is always a topic sentence. %%Paragraph* 2:%%According to the requirements of the question, you are only allowed to state the issue or cause in this paragraph and provide a hint as to its outcome.
    %%Sentences 2 and 3: Describe the result and how it affects the subject in this sentence.However, if you are asked about the cause, you must explain how the problem in the question came to be and what caused it to become a cause.It is your responsibility to make the examiner understand, and you must assume that the person reading the answer does not know anything.In addition, you won't be present to explain, so write responses that the examiner can fully comprehend without you.
    %%Sentence 4: The example sentence is this one.
   %% Example Paragraph Primarily, if the sea level rises, it will undoubtedly flood homes.With a few feet of rise in the water level, many settlements will drown because many cities are on the seashore.Consequently, millions of people who live in those homes will become homeless and will suffer a significant loss of property.In fact, many people may die.For instance, many of the Maldives' islands are now submerged in the water, forcing many people to flee their homes and permanently losing their land.
    %%Sentence 1 in this sentence; %%Paragraph* 3 %%Body paragraph 2provide a solution to the issue described in the second paragraph.
  %%  Second sentence: %%Sentence 2describe how the proposed solution will resolve the issue.Again, you need to explain what you mean because the examiner may not be an expert in this field.
    %%Sentence 3: Provide an example that can demonstrate the suitability of your solution.
    %%Sample Paragraph %%One of the most effective solutions to this issue would be to construct enormous dams on the shores of the ocean.Despite the fact that people are being educated about global warming, they are primarily concerned with making money rather than the environment.As a result, it is in everyone's best interest to construct massive barricades so that the water can't reach the people's homes and save lives.The Netherlands is a good example in this regard.This nation has utilized various flood defense systems with success.
    %%Paragraph* 4: %%Conclusion %%Sentence 1: In this paragraph, the main points of paragraphs 2 and 3 are summarized.
    %%Sample Paragraph %%In conclusion, one of the primary threats we face is the rising sea level as a result of the constant rise in global temperature. It is certain that many homes along the coast will be submerged, but employing various flood deterrent mechanisms like Holland could be a viable option.

  %%  As the point recommends, you should examine about the advantage(s) and disadvantage(s) of specific things, cycles, and activities, whatever is posed in the inquiry.Unless you are asked to provide your opinion, THIS IS NOT AN OPINION QUESTION.You'll need to be objective when discussing the benefits and drawbacks.
  %%  In this type of question, you are most likely to encounter three distinct types of questions.
    %%i.Advantage/Disadvantage* %% In this type, you will only be required to write about the advantages and disadvantages.You will need to show how it is advantageous or disadvantageous and provide an illustration to back up your claim.
   %% Example of a Question:The government spends a lot of tax money on children's education.What are the benefits and drawbacks of this?
    %%ii.Which offsets which;advantage or disadvantage %% In the same way that the question above requires you to present the advantages and disadvantages, an impartial presentation will not suffice.You will need to demonstrate why one is more powerful than the other.Don't forget to provide an example as support.
  %%  Example of a Question:The government spends a lot of tax money on children's education.Is the benefit of this greater than the drawback?
    %% Structure for TYPE 1 This type's structure is comparable to agree/disagree or problem/solution.The content you include is the only difference.This means that before giving an example, you will need to present or explain the advantage or disadvantage.
  %%  The introduction to the first paragraph and the first sentence of the question are both examples of paraphrasing.Please refer to previous chapters if you have forgotten how to paraphrase.
    %%Sentence 2: Outline the sentence In this section, you must mention one benefit and one drawback.You might think that I say yes if there is only one benefit and one disadvantage.You can mention a couple if you want to, but this has two drawbacks:One is that you don't have enough time, and the other is that you might get lost in the middle and make a mistake with your answer.
    %%Sentence 1: Topic sentence (Advantage 1)%% As always, you cannot skip a topic sentence in paragraph 2 (Advantages).It serves as a prelude to your paragraph.Simply select the benefit that you mentioned in the outline sentence, paraphrase it, and write it down.
    %%Sentence 2: Describe how this is an advantage In this sentence, you are required to explain either why you believe this is an advantage or how it is achieved.
    %%Sentence 3: An Example You are required to provide a logically connected example in this sentence.The example does not have to be true—no one will ever verify it—but it must be logically connected.
    %%Sentence 6: Topic sentence (Disadvantage 1) In this sentence, simply rewrite the disadvantage from the outline sentence. %%Paragraph 3: Disadvantages*
    %%Sentence 7: Describe how this is a drawback. Here, you must elaborate on your concept.You must demonstrate how it is a disadvantage while doing this.
    %%Sentence 8: An Example Provide an example with logical connections.
    %%Conclusion %%Sentence 9—Recap of the main points Provide a synopsis of your explanation.
   %% Note:Don't share your thoughts.
   %% Sample Response: %% With the rise of e-books comes a decline in paper books.Certain individuals consider it to be a decent step in the right direction while some don't.
   %% What are this trend's benefits and drawbacks?
   %% Hard-cover book production has decreased as a result of increased production of virtual books.In contrast to other people, a significant number of people take it positively.The fact that a significant portion of the forest will be preserved is the trend's primary benefit; health issues are its primary drawback.
   %% First and foremost, one advantage of electronic books is that they do not result in the destruction of vegetation.That is to say, in order to provide books to the general public, a large number of trees are felled annually.These trees, on the other hand, will remain safe in their natural environments if this trend shifts to virtual books.Additionally, it will lead to a healthier and greener environment.For instance, a report distributed in a diary, Manageability, expresses that after the presentation of delicate books a large number of trees are saved consistently.
   %% However, there are also some drawbacks.Concerns about one's health rank high among them.Put another way, people spend a lot of time looking at screens on their computers or tablets.People's vision is affected in a negative way by the screen's radiation and blue light.Furthermore, stooping to read may result in spinal injuries.For instance, in 2019, only a small percentage of Americans reported feeling uneasy on their necks, and one in ten were prescribed glasses due to prolonged screen time.
   %% In conclusion, despite their benefits, e-books also have drawbacks.While it is essential to the preservation of the flora and fauna, it also poses a threat to users' health.
 %%	Structure for TYPE 2* (which offsets which)
 %%  In this sort of inquiry, since you need to demonstrate either there are more benefits or detriments;Two points must be written for the stronger side, and one point must be written for the weaker side.Your example in the third paragraph must support the stronger side while also demonstrating that the weaker side is wrong. However, you do not need to explain the weaker side.
   %% Outline sentence Paragraph 2 (Stronger Side) %%Sentence 4- Topic Sentence %%Sentence 5- Explain why it is strong %%Sentence 6- Example %Sentence 7- Topic Sentence %%Sentence 8- Explain why it is strong %%Sentence 9- Example Paragraph 3 (Weaker Side) %%Sentence 10- Topic Sentence %%Sentence 11- Explain why it is weak %%S
   %% Sample Response%% A few experts believe that primary schools are a better place for children to begin learning a foreign language than secondary schools.
   %% Are the benefits of this greater than the drawbacks?
   %% Professionals believe that it is also beneficial for students to begin learning at least one foreign language in primary school rather than secondary school.This essay will argue that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.The first thing this essay will show is that learning a foreign language at a young age gives you control over it and helps you think better.Second, it will talk about why confusion with their mother tongue, a major deficiency, is not true.
  %%  The primary reason children are required to learn a nonnative language at a young age is to increase the likelihood that they will be proficient in it when they reach adulthood.To put it another way, if they begin learning the language early on, after years of practice, they will speak and be fluent in the language as well as in their native tongue.For instance, since primary school children in Saudi Arabia receive English language instruction, nearly 80% of local adults can speak English as fluently as Arabic.Learning a new language, on the other hand, also helps improve overall cognitive abilities.That is, children will be able to expand their capacity for thinking and analysis.Tribhuwan University's survey, for instance, found that students who could speak two or more languages before the age of ten performed better on IQ tests and solved more problems.
   %% This is not true, according to those who argue that teaching children a second language confuses them with their native tongue.In any case, there is fundamentally no any verification to help this standpoint as bilingual posterity simply fine with both the dialects.As an illustration, children from the Newar community in Nepal can write and speak both Nepali and Newari fluently.
   %% Overall, learning a second language at a young age not only gives children a chance to practice and become fluent in it, but it also improves brain function, which clearly outweighs the erroneous claim that it confuses them with their native language.

   %%This is not your typical type of question.You only need to respond to the question in this type of question.Typically, a statement is accompanied by two questions.You must respond to both questions in two separate paragraphs.It has some similarities to the Problem/Solution essay format.
%% Structure %%Paragraph* 1 (Introduction) %%Sentence 1 – Question %%Sentence 2 – Outline sentence (answer to first and second questions) %%Paragraph* 2 (answer to first question) %%Sentence 1 – Topic Sentence %%Sentence 2 – Explain %%Sentence 3 – Example %%Paragraph* 4 (Conclusion) %%SentenceWhat methods are these?Which strategy is most efficient?
%%Businesses use a variety of strategies to increase the trade of their products.The distribution of advertisements across various communication channels will be the topic of the first section of this essay, which will then turn to the most efficient marketing strategy: social media.
%%First and foremost, almost all businesses rely on advertisements;on radio, television, social media, Google, and billboards so that their products sell more quickly.Television commercials featuring well-known actors and athletes to persuade people and their followers to purchase the products they endorse are one of the most well-established strategies.For instance, a beauty product called "Fair and Handsome" now has Shah Rukh Khan's endorsement, and a news report stated that sales increased significantly compared to when a less well-known model was featured.
%%However, the internet has proven to be the most effective form of advertising in today's world.That is to say, people now spend more time using social media like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube than reading newspapers or watching television.Because these media have the option to share the content, people who missed the original post are more likely to see the shared posts, which means more reach and sales.For instance, a 2015 study by the Philippine Business Club found that because most young people are active on social media, Twitter has been a successful tool for launching new products to people between the ages of 18 and 25.
%% In conclusion, a variety of methods can make a product popular with customers.Because it can reach the majority of people in any part of the world and because the number of everyday internet users is on the rise, social media is the most effective advertising tool.
