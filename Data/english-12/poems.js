%%The main points:
%%In her poem "A Day," Emily Dickinson uses beautiful imagery and symbols to describe a beautiful day that transforms children's innocence into experience.
%%In this poem, Emily depicts the sunset and sunrise as a village and its inhabitants.However, the poem also shows how difficult it is to recognize our surroundings and the world around us.The speaker of the poem makes clear how the sun rises, what happens after it rises, and how it sets in the poem.The church steeple takes on the color of amethyst when its ribbon-like rays fall upon it at sunrise.The Squirrels can run as fast as the news about Sunrise gets out.The dark hills can be seen in the early morning light, and a small American bird known as the bobolink begins to sing.All living things are happy and content thanks to the Sun's warmth.In order to confirm that the Sunrise with its lovely and magnificent beams is real, the speaker speaks to himself.The poem is divided into four beautiful stanzas, each of which uses different imagery and symbols to describe a beautiful day.The poem can be broken up into two parts:an eight-line section about the sunrise and an eight-line section about how the speaker thinks the sunset is wrong.
%%Stanza 1: I'll tell you, one ribbon at a time, how the sun rose.
%%Amethyst-colored steeples surrounded the news like squirrels.
%%The speaker tells the readers how the sun rises at the beginning of the poem.The speaker refers to the rays of the sun as "ribbons."The steeple glows amethyst when the sun shines on it.These "ribbons" are stacked in a gradual manner.The "news" about this sensation spreads quickly.The speaker's immature worldview is reflected in his or her enthusiasm for sunrise.By focusing on seemingly insignificant details, this persona sends the message to readers that it is acceptable to pause and appreciate "normal" changes in the natural world, such as the sunrise.This stanza also makes a metaphorical reference to the enthusiasm that comes with the beginning of life, such as giving birth.Additionally, Emily Dickinson's religious upbringing is hinted at by the mention of "Steeples," a portion of a church building.
%%Stanza 2: The bobolinks began as the hills untied their caps.
%%After that, I thought to myself softly, "That must have been the sun!"
%%The events that transpire as a result of sunrise are described in this stanza.Bobolinks, a type of blackbird, begin to sing as the sun rises above "Hills."Similar natural events that appear to be in response to the rising sun are highlighted in this stanza.It calls readers' attention once more to the splendor of nature all around them and encourages them to be more thankful for it.The speaker of this line exclaims, "That must have been the Sun!" to convey his or her awe.Because no adult would require much description to recognize the sun or its rising, this statement indicates that the speaker is a child.
%%Stanza 3: I have no idea how he set.
%%The subject matter in this stanza shifts from sunrise to sunset, and the speaker's tone shifts from excited to reserved. There seemed to be a purple stile that little yellow boys and girls were climbing all the time.Because the child is so ignorant about sunsets, his or her self-esteem plummets.Nevertheless, the persona describes what they are able to do, which is less exciting than it is exciting.This stanza is more metaphorical than literal because Dickinson uses it to show the transition from life to death.The poem "A Day" uses metaphor to show readers how little any living thing knows about death.Humans, like the child speaker, keep their thoughts on the terrible subject to a minimum and prefer to discuss more exciting subjects.On the other hand, the literal imagery in this stanza depicts the rising sun moving from the East to the West.
%%Stanza 4: When they got to the other side, a gray dominion raised the evening bars gently and led the flock away.
%%The poem "A Day," Emily Dickinson's final stanza, reveals her faith.The poet's own perspective on death is shown through Christian themes like "flock" and "Dominie in gray" in this purely symbolic stanza.According to Dickinson, in the same way that a "flock" refers to "human beings" and a "Dominie in gray" refers to "God," God directs human beings wherever they go after death.On the other hand, the stanza literally ushers in the evening as the sun sets.Due to the present inactivity, the speaker lacks passion at this point.Consequently, "A Day" comes to an abrupt end.
        
%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. In the first stanza, how does the poet describe the morning sun?*
%%The speaker of this poem describes the early morning sun in the first stanza.The sun's first dazzling golden rays wrap around it like ribbons.It brightens and makes everything visible.The steeple takes on an amethyst hue as a result.
%%b. What does it mean when it says, "The news like squirrels ran"?*
%%The first stanza's line "The news like Squirrels ran" suggests that the news of the sun rising and its rays being cast spreads as quickly as squirrels run.The word "like" is used to compare the swift movement of the squirrels to the news of the sun's horizon.
%%c. What do you take the phrase "The hills untied their bonnets" to mean?*
%%The hills are enveloped in darkness before the sun rises.All of the hills appear stunningly green as the sun rises.When the first rays of sunlight reach the hills, they toss their bonnets aside.This line depicts the hills as women untying their bonnets, making them personified.
%%d. Is the speaker paying attention to the rising sun?*Why?*Why not?*
%%Yes, the speaker is looking at the sun rising.The speaker is observing the steeple turning an amethyst color, like the untied bonnets of the hills.Additionally, he is hearing the beautiful bobolinks sing, confirming that the speaker is observing the sunrise.
%%e. How is the sunset observed?*
%%In point of fact, the speaker is not visible to the setting sun.She is unaware of the location where the sun sets.Due to her ignorance of the sunset, she is unaware of what happens after the purple and yellow hues indicate the sun's setting.
%%Reference to the Context*%% a. The speaker's definition of a day
%%The speaker asserts that a day is about seeing the ordinary things in life through their childlike eyes.
%%b. In the poem, what function does the hyphen in the first line serve?*
%%A hyphen (-) is a punctuation mark that is used in writing to connect two or more words.A hyphen is used in poetry to indicate a pause.In her poem, Emily Dickinson uses punctuation marks in a novel way.She uses hyphens when she can't find the right words to express her deepest feelings, to allow readers to imagine and find the missing words, and to demonstrate the power of silence in certain circumstances.It is also used to emphasize something suddenly.
%%c. What gives this poem its lyrical and musical quality?*Discuss.
%%Emily Dickenson's poem "A Day" is both lyrical and sonorous.The poem is lyrical in the sense that it uses first-person narration to convey personal feelings or emotions.In lyrical poems, the poetic persona is indicated by the first pronoun, "I."The poetess is describing her own personal experience of seeing the sunrise in this brief poem."Sonorous" refers to verse or language that is rich in sound and sound.A poem is musical and melodic because of a number of factors.A poem is musical when it uses sound devices like alliteration, assonance, rhyme, and rhythm.
%%d. Who is the speaker's intended audience?*Why?*
%%The people for whom a poet writes or composes a poem are the audience.The world is seen through the eyes of a young child in the poem.In the end, it remains mysterious despite its stunning beauty.The first line begins, "I'll tell you how the sun rose," and the speaker is narrating the sunrise.From this vantage point, we can deduce that the intended audience consists of other young children who have awakened too late to enjoy this stunning sunrise.At the point when we dissect the sonnet rationally, the whole mankind is additionally the main interest group.The beautiful sunrise represents the beginning of life, the day's activities are a journey through life, and the setting sun is a symbol of death.
%%e. It appears that the poem is describing a day for children.How would this poem be received by adults?*Write the response based on your parents' or guardians' responses to this poem.
%%In a literal sense, the poem "A Day" describes the sunrise, subsequent events, and sunset.However, in a philosophical sense, the poem discusses death and life.The poem tells us about life's beginning excitement, a squirrel running like life, and the life's mysterious end.
%%Beyond the text: a. Create a poem based on your own experience by observing your surroundings one fine morning.
%%You can take a look around your surroundings by getting up early in the morning in order to write a poem in response to this question.In the morning, you might see birds, houses, fog, the sun, and a peaceful environment.Pick a specific idea or theme from the objects around you to use in your poem.You can also enhance your poem by employing simile, metaphor, and other literary devices.Here are just a few examples:
%%metaphor and simile For a better understanding, read Victoria Black's poem "Surrounding."

 %%Brief Summary:*
%%Under the Milk Wood contains an excerpt of the poem "Every Morning I Wake."Thomas begs the majestic God to have mercy on the common people who live beneath the Milk Wood in this poem.
%%This poem is a prayer to the amazing God who was made by a tiny human being.The speaker of the poem is an example of people who are born and die but never experience anything.The speaker is a devotee of God and is aware of God's true power. As a result, whenever he wakes up in the morning, he prays to God for mercy toward all living things.The speaker prays not only for his own good but also for the good of all living things.They are living on this planet, but God has the remote control.Everything on Earth is created and destroyed by God.The speaker begs Him to be merciful because He is eternal and all-powerful.
%%We must die as mortals, but God's blessings make our lives beautiful.The speaker is asking God to bless them because he is unsure whether they will see him tomorrow morning and is praying to God before going to bed.In the course of our day-to-day lives, we may be good or bad, but only God knows our best qualities.Every night, God's blessings allow us to see them in the morning.As a result, the speaker kneels and begs God to keep them alive through the night.Even though it's unlikely that the speaker will be able to wake up the next morning, the speaker bids farewell this time, but not forever.
%%In-Depth Analysis of the Poem:
%%Verse 1:
%%In this stanza, the speaker begs God to love and keep an eternal eye on all living things, saying, "Dear Lord, a little prayer I make every morning when I wake, O please do keep Thy loving eye On all poor creatures born to die."Not only does he ask God for his own safety, but he also asks for the safety of all the plightful creatures on this planet during the time between birth and death.
%%2nd Stanza:
%%I also ask for a blessing on the town every evening at sunset because it's always uncertain whether we make it through the night.
%%In this stanza, the speaker talks about the unpredictability of life and death.He always prays that the Almighty would make everything right and shield them from danger, even though he is unsure if this is the city's last night.The speaker prays to God before going to bed, but he doesn't know if he'll see them again in the morning, so he asks God to bless them.
%%3. Stanza:
%%Under Milk Wood, we are neither completely good nor bad, and I know that you will be the first to see our best qualities rather than our worst.
%%The speaker tries to make it clear that none of us are perfect or bad in this stanza.We might be thoughtful or horrible over our daily existences, yet just God knows our best selves.The speaker prays to God in this way, asking him to keep them alive until the next day.Particularly, the speaker serves as a representation of Milk Wood town and ensures that they are neither entirely bad nor entirely good.They may be judged in different ways by others;Everything depends on how one views other people.However, the speaker appeared to have faith that God knows the Milk Wood people's best qualities.He also asks God to focus on the good aspects of people rather than the bad ones.
%%Section 4:
%%O let us hope for a better day!
%%I ask you to bless us all tonight, and we will all bow to the sun and say goodbye—but only for the time being!
%%The speaker tries to end his prayers in the final stanza.The speaker trusts that the night will pass rapidly and that the exquisite day will return.The night is depicted in this poem.It alludes to the difficulties, stress, and difficult times that he and the residents of the town faced.Additionally, he begs the Almighty to assist them during their trying times.A prayer's conclusion is symbolized by the final Goodbye.This time, the speaker says their farewell, however the individual in question knows that they will be impermanent and the following day will be the fresh start by god's effortlessness.
%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. At what times does the speaker pray to God?*
%%The speaker prays to God both when he wakes up in the morning and before going to bed at night.
%%b. For what purpose does the speaker pray?*
%%The speaker asks God to grant the residents of Milk Wood grace and blessings.
%%c. Who exactly are these "poor creatures?*"Why is the speaker referring to them as "poor creatures"?*
%%The individuals who live beneath Milk Wood—as well as humanity as a whole—are the "poor creatures" in particular.They are referred to as poor creatures by the speaker because they are born to die and are made of bone and flesh.
%%d. What sounds like Milk Wood?*a region or a kind of wood?*Why?*
%%Milk Wood suggests a location because there is no preceding article.A grammatical article such as "a," "an," or "the" must have been used because it is not a type of wood.A single proper noun referring to a specific location does not require an article.
%%e. For what reason do the occupants of Milk Wood bow to the sunset 'however only for the time being'?*
%%In order to bid farewell to the evening, the inhabitants of Milk Wood bow to the setting sun "but just for now."They anticipate seeing the sun the following morning.With God's help and the sun's warmth, they long to live another day.
%%Discussion of "Every Morning When I Wake" as a prayer to God a. Refer to the context.
%%“Every Morning When I Wake” by Dylan Thomas is a prayer poem.The speaker prays, "Dear Lord, a small prayer I make, O please do keep Thy loving eye On all poor creatures born to die."The speaker is asking God to watch over all creatures in need and shower them with blessings.The speaker of a prayer poem asks God for blessings and direction throughout his life and the lives of all humans and animals.
%%b. Why does the speaker pray to God but not to a scientist, billionaire, or king?*
%%The speaker prays to God because He is the supreme deity, the creator, and the primary object of faith.He is all-present, all-powerful, and all-knowing.Scientists, billionaires, and kings are all made of flesh and bones and destined to die.No matter how much power they have, how much money they have, or how much knowledge they have, they are never compared to God.They are also under the control of God.He created us, saved us, loves us, trusts us, and directs us in the right direction. He is a holy being.We worship him for this reason, to receive his blessings and mercy.Scientists, wealthy people, and monarchs are all fleeting beings.They cannot protect us as effectively as God does.God is the reason a king is in his position, a scientist is able to learn new things, and a billionaire is able to make a lot of money.
%%c. In what manner does the poet emphasize the magnificence of God?*
%%Through the speaker's morning and nightly prayers, the poet emphasizes the magnificence of God.Since God is aware of every aspect of the creature, his blessings sustain us throughout the day.
%%d. In what ways does the poem's rhyme scheme support its message?*
%%The arranged pattern of rhyming words at the end of each poem line is called a rhyme scheme.This poem makes use of linked rhyme, which means that each stanza's two lines rhyme together.In the AABB rhyme scheme, lines 1 and 2 rhyme with each other, and lines 3 and 4 rhyme with each other.The poem's rhyme scheme is AABB, CCDD, EEFF, and GGHH throughout.The rhymes have the sound of catchy music.Because of its simplicity, it conveys the natural beauty of childhood.The speaker is a helpless being in God's eyes.This rhyme structure is used in the majority of prayer poems to make an innocent plea to God.
%%Reference outside of the text*%% a. Is there a God?*Share your thoughts.
%%"Is there a God?*"is the most controversial issue that has been debated since the beginning of human civilization.There are two kinds of people on this planet who hold the belief that there is a God.Some people, who are referred to as "atheists," do not believe in God, whereas "theists" do.I believe God exists, despite the fact that some people question its existence.Some people contend that God does not exist because no one has actually seen Him or because our senses do not perceive God's presence.However, even if we do not feel or see objects with our sense organs, this does not mean that they do not exist.We have a sixth sense, in addition to our five sense organs, that enables us to communicate with God.It is a perceptual power, in contrast to our five senses.Through our five senses, we are accustomed to feeling and experiencing the physical world.Humans, on the other hand, do not use their sixth sense.People who use their sixth sense have faith in God.Our religious sensibility is the cause.The existence of radiation is comparable to that of God.We only observe the outcomes.God is invisible to us, but we can feel his presence in our lives.God's existence is demonstrated by events that are miraculous and unexpected.
%%b. Voltaire writes, "Even if the God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent him" in his 1768 Epistle to the author of The Three Impostors.Write an essay that emphasizes how important God is to society.
%%"Even if God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent him," states the importance of God in society.This idea was expressed in the 18th-century French philosopher Voltaire's "The Three Imposters"He emphasizes the human need to believe in a divine being named God.He is the creator or ruler of nature in addition to being a supreme intelligence with enormous power.The world is a mess without God.There are deaths, damages, and destruction if there is no God.The greatest creator has preserved this planet's beauty.It is necessary for everyone in every culture to have faith in Him.A civilized society must function effectively.While evil represents all of our society's negative aspects, God symbolizes all of our society's positive aspects.
%%We follow God's path of righteousness.It teaches us, among other things, moral values like humanity, kindness, love, and compassion.He teaches us, among other things, to let go of vengeance, lust, passion, and desires.Positive individuals contribute to the development of any culture's civilization.Peace and harmony continue to prevail among people.There is a sense of security.People have a fear of God before they do anything wrong.A person's fear of God does not lead them to commit sin.Therefore, it is essential to create an ideal life for God even if He does not exist.
%%The majority of people who believe that our souls will be present with us after we die believe in God.Their souls will suffer in purgatory if they do not repent of their actions in this world.Those whose lives are guided by morality and uprightness can rest contentedly in heaven after death.People go on to say that a sense of God's existence is the root of this idea.Every community's ideals and beliefs contribute to the civilization of the society in which they live.Therefore, God is necessary for civilization's advancement and well-being;otherwise, he must be made up.

        %%The main points:
%%In the poem "I Was My Own Route," the radical feminist speaker Julia de Burgos challenges the masculine notion of defining a female's life and journey along traditional paths.She connects male mindset to orientation imbalance and male biases towards ladies.
%%This poem depicts women's own liberation and freedom.Because of this, she also rejects the masculine idea that a woman's life should be decided by men and follow traditional paths.She makes a connection between gender inequality and men's prejudices against women and masculine thinking.She is trying to find a new, independent route for her own journey.She is in favor of women's liberation and rights.The poem demonstrates that men and women share the same significance.Accordingly, her life ought not be affected by the thoughts of others, as the law ensures females similar key privileges as men.
%%Above all else, the moral of the poem is that men and women belong to the same society, need freedom, liberty, and independence, and should be allowed to follow their own paths rather than those set by patriarchal society.
%%Analyses of Poems:
%%Stanza 1 I desired to conform to men's expectations:
%%an effort to live;
%%my being in a game of hide-and-seek.
%%But I was made of nows, and my feet on the promissory earth wouldn't let me go backwards. Instead, I went forward, forward, and made fun of the ashes to reach the kiss of new paths.
%%The speaker emphasizes the differences between what was expected of her and who she was in the first stanza.She doesn't believe in patriarchy and wants to forge her own path rather than play the usual game of hide and seek.She examines her very own freedom as well as ladies' strengthening through this.She's searching for better approaches to deal with her excursion, as opposed to following the street that has been laid out or set by manly citizenry.She makes fun of these paths and takes a different one that she likes.In response to the social inequalities that existed at the time, Julia de Burgos says that this poem makes an agenda of gender discrimination.
%%Stanza 2: The old guard's desperate flapping wings tore at my back with each step I took forward.
%%In the second stanza, the speaker encounters a number of male-made social conventions as obstacles in her newly forwarded path, but she overcomes all obstacles and old determined feet.She talks about how, with her broken heart and old blogs, she was brought back to the old, traditional way of looking at things.
%%Stanza 3: My gaze drifted further and further away from the far-off, familiar horizons as the branch was forever unpinned;
%%and the definite expression on my face that suggested a sense of intimate liberation and the expansion that came from within;
%%a sensation that emerged from my life's equilibrium and the truth of the new paths' kiss.
%%The speaker endures a great deal in the third refrain with a feeling of freedom to adjust her own life to proceed with the new and genuine way of life.She wants to travel far into the future and experience all of the liberations that men have already achieved.Consequently, she kisses multiple paths to various levels of happiness and freedom in life.
%%Stanza 4: With my course already set in the present, I felt like a blossom from all the earth's soils—the soils without history, the soils without a future, and the soils that never had any boundaries between men or eras.
%%In the fourth stanza, the persona finds herself in a predetermined situation where there is no history, future, boundaries, or anything else besides the world and the limitations of men and women under the shadow of men.Women are confined to the four walls of their homes as a result of Patriarchy's various barriers.Her current difficulties are surrounded by numerous challenges and patriarchal social norms.It shows a world where women seem to be hopeless.
%%Stanza 5: "And I was all in me as was life in me..." The speaker wants to convey the strength that comes from choosing one's own path by using the phrase "And I was all in me as was life in me..." in the fifth stanza.The speaker had a wonderful chance to meet and connect with her real selves.Her life is now completely understood and independent.
%%Stanza 6 I desired to conform to men's expectations:
%%an effort to live;
%%my being in a game of hide-and-seek.
%%However, I was made up of nows;
%%When I was announced by the heralds at the old guard's regal parade, my desire to follow men changed, and the homage was left waiting for me.
%%In the sixth stanza, the speaker reveals to her who she was and what the male community members wanted her to be.She then goes on to say that because she works so hard to be who she wants to be, she was everything in herself.The speaker reveals her own attempt to deviate from what patriarchal society desired by returning to the first stanza.She is determined to overcome the difficult circumstances in her life, despite feeling quite depressed about the gloomy future that lies ahead of her.
%%      
%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. For what reason did the speaker attempt to be the manner in which men maintained that her should be?*
%%The speaker made an effort to act the way men wanted her to because she wanted to see how men would act and what they would expect of her because of their patriarchal idea of men.
%%b. From her feet, "would not accept walking backwards," what do you understand?*
%%By her feet, she "would not accept walking backwards." We understand that she wanted to race like men and have the same resources as them in order to achieve independence and equality.
%%c. Who are the traditionalists?*Why did they become so hopeless?*
%%Traditionalists who are fixated on the patriarchal system make up the old guard.When they observe the poetess striving for independence and improving the lives of the poor, they become depressed.
%%d. In what manner did the speaker experience "an intimate liberation"?*
%%The speaker experienced "a feeling of intimate liberation" as she crossed the barrier of patriarchal society and kissed a new path of liberation instead of the one that was previously defined by males.
%%e. Why did the speaker become warped in her desire to follow men?*
%%➜ On account of the pre-laid out male centric culture and its principles, the speaker's craving to follow men distorted in her.She yearned for freedom and pleasure, but she was forced to conform to men's preconceived notions.
%%Reference to the Context*
%% a. When the speaker says, "I was playing hide and seek with my being," what exactly does she mean by that?*
%%The speaker is attempting to demonstrate her rebellious character and rejection of the masculine mentality that confines women to four walls when she says she was playing hide-and-seek with her being in the third line of the first stanza and again at the end of the poem.It also suggests that she needs to be freed from the gender stereotype of females in order to follow her own path.
%%b. Why, in your opinion, did the old guards tear her back while she was moving forward?*
%% In my opinion, the old guards ripped her back as she moved forward because, as she moved forward, the old guard established a number of obstacles, norms, and threats of patriarchal ideology.In this context, the old guard relate to ancient customs, cultures, norms, and patriarchal values. However, she wants freedom and needs to be free because of her race.Her back was ripped and she suffered greatly as a result of the limitations, obstacles, problems, and blockades imposed by the society's old guard.
%%c. The speaker said, "What did it feel like to be free?*"
%%The speaker asserts that freedom entails the capacity to pursue one's goals and chart one's own course without being constrained by societal or masculine norms.It entails walking and feeling like a man, participating in society in every way as a man, and receiving the liberation they have desired for a long time.Defying the patriarchal ideology that was imposed on women by the old guard, for her, it's the same as choosing her own path and performing her own duty.
%%d. For what reason does the speaker favor the present to the past?*
%%The speaker chooses the present over the past because her past was unpleasant, difficult, and troublesome.She had experienced a great deal in her life.She suffered greatly from patriarchal mentality.She was constrained by patriarchal laws.She was the one with whom people laughed and played.She was unaware of the liberation and emancipation of her heart.Based on her wishes, she could only do so much.Her family abused, exploited, and denied her everything.She does, however, currently feel liberated and free of patriarchal ideas.Ideology among men is eroding at an alarming rate.Freedom has begun to benefit women, and strong, male-dominated ideas are becoming less prevalent in contemporary culture.She believes that she is completely in control of her actions and choices.
%%She can work and travel wherever she pleases.The speaker therefore values the present over the past.
%%e.g., "No man is an island entirely of itself" is a line from the poem "No Man is an Island" by John Donne.Burgos might concur with Donne.Do you agree with Burgos or Donne?*
%%"No man is an island entirely of itself," says John Donne in his poem "No Man is an Island."He is talking about the entire human race and how important they are to society's development.The idea that humans can't function well on their own and must be a part of a community to survive is represented by the expression "no man is an island."It demonstrates that no one can live completely on their own and that everyone needs the company and comfort of others to survive.I support John Donne's idea of societal equality in all aspects and agree with him.He talks about equality between men and women, but Burgos looks angry and upset about the culture that is dominated by men. She also says that she doesn't like male philosophy and ideas that make it harder for women to have freedoms and opportunities in society.She appears to be a radical feminist who challenges male norms and beliefs while also advocating for female freedom.In any case, I admire Donne because he advocates for the advancement of men and women as well as society as a whole.
%%Beyond the text, make references*%% a. Write an essay about My Idea of Freedom.
%% An Essay on My Concept of Freedom Everyone has heard of freedom, but when asked to define it, their responses will vary.This is because everyone has a different idea of what freedom is.For some, freedom means being able to go wherever they want, for others, it means being able to stand up for what they believe in, and for still more, it means being able to do whatever they want.
%%The freedom to violate and disregard other rights is not the right to be free.In addition, being free means taking pleasure in the splendor of our surroundings and the natural world.The true worth of something can only be appreciated by those who have earned it or sacrificed their lives for it.Freedom is also synonymous with freedom from oppression.It also refers to, among other things, freedom from racism, harm, hostility, and discrimination.
%%Moreover, opportunity considers open discussions, which help in the trading of significant thoughts and contemplations for the progression of society.In addition, this is the only right that is directly related to all other rights.More importantly, it is essential to express one's opinions on a variety of subjects and society.
%%In a nutshell, we could say that freedom is not what we think it is.It is a mental model that everyone interprets differently.Similarly, different individuals value it differently.Happiness, on the other hand, is strongly correlated with freedom.
%%b. However, it would appear that not everyone shares Burgos's belief in freedom.In his novel Requiem for a Nun, for instance, William Faulkner asserts, "The past is never dead."It's even not over.We are all caught in webs of heredity and environment, desire and consequences, history and eternity that were created long before we were born.What do you think of Faulkner?*Why?*Why not?*
%%Obviously, not everyone seems to support the freedom that Burgos advocates in this poem.In his novel Requiem for a Nun, William Faulkner writes, "The past is never dead."It's not even past.We are all caught in webs of heredity and environment, desire and consequences, history and eternity that were created long before we were born.
%%All that we do and encounter later on will become history.In the webs that we have been weaving since the beginning of time, we are caught in the crossfire of history and karma that began before we were even born.Like time, our existence follows a straight line.The past will always be around us.If we are still thinking about it and making decisions based on it, it is impossible to say that something happened.Regardless of what took place, it is a part of our history, but the memories it evokes live on in our minds, so the past never really ends.It suggests that we are always entangled in the past.It will remain with us until we die.
%%Because her past was so unpleasant, Julia Burgos' poem "I Was My Own Route" might lead us to believe that she wants to be completely free of it.However, achieving this is challenging.The idea that Julia de Burgos had a past completely vanishes when she fights for her independence.By denying the past and rejecting men's existence, she desires to escape their presence in order to establish her own identity.On the other hand, the world will end if men are ignored.She is a radical feminist, which suggests that she is furious at the way men rule women.The survival of humanity depends on the presence of both genders.Our identities and every choice we make are shaped by our past.In contrast to what Burgos expresses in her poems, his perspective on the past is realistic.Because it helps us along every path of our life, we can't completely ignore our past.Therefore, I wholeheartedly concur with Faulkner over Burgos because his viewpoints and concepts are grounded in reality and truth.

        description: `
        %%Ben Okri, a poet, depicts the struggles of Africans and calls for peace, unity, and solidarity among people from all over the world in the poem "The Awakening Age."This poem shows how hunger, poverty, unemployment, and ethnic, religious, political, terrorism, militancy, electoral, and other conflicts have made Nigerians a vulnerable community over time.The Igho people have been oppressed by northern Nigeria, which has led to ethnoreligious conflict.Even though they are led by unseen forces, the people of the poem tell the story of how optimism holds them together like glue.
%%The speaker is attempting to address the new individuals of Nigeria, who have endured extraordinarily because of Nigeria's terrible slaughter brought about by ethnic, strict, geological, and monetary factors, and empowering them to share a brought together vision of a new, serene, and effective country in the primary couplet.An imaginary line that divides the Earth into two hemispheres is known as a meridian line in geography.In the poetry, it refers to the tensions and divisions that split Nigerians in half.The transformation of Nigerians from a land of struggle, poverty, and division during the civil war to one of peace and harmony is symbolized by traveling this Meridian line.
%%In the second couplet, the poet asks the Nigerian people to dream of a united nation that shines with joy, harmony, prosperity, and unity.The awakening age is celebrated after the conflict, when all Nigerians have stopped being enraged and hateful to one another.
%%In the third couplet, the speaker declares that the goal of nation-building must unite all people.People had hoped for a prosperous nation for a long time, but the ongoing conflicts prevented it.Numerous sects were used to divide people.This hope brings people together like a sturdy mountain rope.
%%The speaker asserts in the fourth couplet that no nation can reach new heights until its citizens are united.They must be free of conflicts, inequalities, and negativity within themselves if they are to bring prosperity to their nation.To move from poverty and division to peace, prosperity, and unity, they must cross the barrier.
%%In the fifth couplet, the poet emphasizes that individuals must alter their narrow perspective in order to acquire the best prospects.They were confronted with difficulties, challenges, poverty, wars, and social division in the past.The country's decline can be attributed to these factors.The suffering will continue indefinitely if these individuals continue to ignore this fact.
%%In the sixth couplet, the poet makes it clear that poverty and misery are self-inflicted and can only be reduced through collaborative efforts that utilize wisdom, creativity, and acquired resources.
%%In the seventh couplet, the speaker adds that any nation will have peace, harmony, and brotherhood if everyone shares a sense of nationalism.There must be no racial, cultural, religious, political, or economic division among individuals.We can lead our country to success by surrendering things like this.The people of Nigeria are united and aware of their previous sorrows, allowing them to enjoy the benefits of love now.
%%   
%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. Who are the "travelers of the meridian line?*"
%%The Nigerians "who travel the meridian line" are divided into two groups as a result of the bloody civil war:both the north and southThese individuals have endured hunger, poverty, unemployment, and other aspects of life throughout their fragmented existence.
%%b. What does "a new world" mean to the poet?*
%%When the poet says, "a new world," he is describing a beautiful world that is full of hope, wealth, unity, truth, knowledge, and creativity.People have experienced the world of a united Nigeria since civil peace was established there.
%%c. How do people communicate with one another?*
%%People are linked to one another by a sense of optimism that stems from their history.They have a lot of faith in their goals, and because of this strong hope, they may reach new heights of prosperity, unity, and knowledge.
%%d. What might we at any point acquire after our insights are changed?*
%%There are a number of advantages we can enjoy once our perceptions are altered.By altering our perceptions, we can gain honesty away from difficulties and suffering.By altering our perceptions, we can gain harmony, integrity, wealth, work, wisdom, and creativity.
%%e. In what ways do new people help us?*
%%We benefit from new people in numerous ways because our solidarity with them propels us toward a prosperous nation.They help us achieve a higher level of inner happiness, sincerity in our opinions, work, knowledge, and creativity.
%%f. Describe the sonnet's rhyme scheme.*
%%The poem has fourteen lines in total, seven separate couplets (stanzas of two lines).The rhyme scheme of this sonnet is straightforward and sonorous, providing a rhythmic tone, and each stanza contains a couplet that rhymes.AA BB CC DD EE FF GG is the rhyme scheme.
%%Reference to the Specific situation*
%%
%%a. What does the artist mean by 'the enlivening age'?*
%%The term "awakening age" refers to the time when Africans began to understand, comprehend, or become aware of their circumstances and the development of their new world.This is the age of enlightenment, following Nigeria's brutal civil war, when people live in peace, prosperity, liberty, happiness, unity, and harmony.
%%%%b. Why, in your opinion, have these individuals "lived with the rage of poverty"?*
%%I believe that Africans were exploited by Europeans during the colonial era for the purpose of extracting natural resources, and as a result, these individuals have "lived with poverty's rage."On the other hand, countries in Africa were involved in a prolonged civil war.There was a disparity in how the wealth of the nation was distributed as a result of the ascendancy of a few powerful individuals over authority.People of ordinary means are unaware that life was not all about poverty.They neglected the plight of ordinary Nigerians and were more preoccupied with internal issues like religion, culture, political philosophy, ethnicity, and so on.
%%c. Why does the poet urge people to stand together?*
%%The poet urges people to work together to realize their dream of a better world.He hopes that the unfortunate citizens of Nigeria will all reach new heights of prosperity, hope, unity, truth, wisdom, and creativity.He believes that people's solidarity can only assist them in overcoming their difficulties.
%%d. Is migration portrayed positively by the poet?*Why?*Why not?*
%%Yes, the poet portrays migration in a positive light because it raises the number of people of working age.Through awakening, migration aids in their transition from one level to another.In a new age of awakening, the poet wishes for them to be united, prosperous, honest, intelligent, and creative without suffering.Migrants bring skills to the countries they are moving to and help build human capital there.Additionally, they encourage the development of cutting-edge technology.
%%e. Nepal is also well-known for the educational and economic migrants it attracts.When these migrants return home from abroad, do you observe any shifts in their perspectives or actions?*
%%Nepal is also well-known for its educational and economic migrants.Yes, I have observed a variety of shifts in these migrants' perceptions and actions upon their return home from abroad.Numerous Nepalese teenagers seek employment and higher education abroad.We have observed a shift in their attitudes and actions when they return home.Going back to your home country has many advantages.People can earn more money, acquire new skills, and save and invest while working abroad.They bring with them both the financial and human capital they acquired abroad when they return home.Only if return migrants are successful in acquiring skills, knowledge, and savings and if their home nation supports policies that encourage them to invest and put their skills to use will they be rewarded.
%%f. Draw parallels between the poet's idealized way of life and the rhyme scheme of this sonnet.*
%%The poem is optimistic, and the rhyme scheme is AA BB CC DD EE FF and GG.The meaning and rhyme of each couplet in each of the seven stanzas are exquisite.With the help of the rhyme pattern in the poem, the poet is able to demonstrate the idealized existence of Nigerians in a new world of the awakening age.These rhyming expressions after couplets are connected to the existences of Nigerians and their optimal lifestyle, including intelligence, acknowledgment, trust, flourishing, truth, opportunity, and delight.His excellent rhyme scheme accurately conveyed his hopes and wishes for Nigerians' ideal existence in the emerging age.
%%a. Write an essay on "The Impacts of Migration on Nepali Society" with references outside of the text.*
%% The Effects of Migration on Nepalese Society Migration is the movement of people from one location to another.Migration can occur within and between nations.The type of migration is permanent, seasonal, or temporary.Migration takes place for a number of reasons.These may be environmental, social, political, or economic in nature.Push and pull factors both influence migration.Both the destination of migrants and their final destination are affected by migration.These effects may have both positive and negative effects.
%%Two kinds of migration occur:Migration and departure.Nepal has a long and increasing history of emigration—more than 200 years.Due to a lack of competent research and, conversely, a lack of interest on the part of the government in this field, there are no effective policies for emigration.The contribution of remittances to GDP has increased as a result of migration; poverty has decreased; the education and health sectors have gradually improved; however, development has been sluggish and the trade deficit has significantly increased.Accordingly, there is a pressing requirement for worldwide movement the executives (counting resettlement and migration) that focuses on public interests.

        title: `5. Soft Storm

        description: `
 %%In the poem "Soft Storm," Subedi ponders the absurdities of turbulent times with compassion.Abhi Subedi's free verse novel Soft Strom is a lovely blend of natural and social depictions.On the surface, it shows the speaker's journey through Kathmandu's dark streets and lights at night; however, on a deeper level, it shows people's feelings of indifference toward the miserable conditions and sufferings of the people, male practices, the turbulent atmosphere, and chaos in Nepalese society.
%%In the first stanza, the poet uses terms like "tumult," "eerie," and so on to describe a disorder in the environment in Nepalese culture. Later, he uses the phrase "sky grew like crocuses" to describe a more positive situation, referring to the Irish floral family plants blooming over stones.These plants grow to five inches tall.At the point when the moon is near set, he talks in banners and governmental issues, as well as about different get-togethers.It's when a group of people talk about social activities in front of each other.He regains his softness by integrating both the natural environment and the social setting as he looks out from his roofs at the rose's gentleness like a gale.He utilizes this likeness to blend two restricting subjects, like the delicate quality of a rose and the strength of a solid breeze, and to reprimand different social misbehaviors committed by individuals in the public eye.After that, he depicts a seamless city with the moon singing and lightning, which some people interpret as a city with an easygoing and inviting atmosphere.
%%He depicts homeless, parentless children in Thamel begging for food and shelter in the second stanza.He criticizes corrupt political leaders who only care about themselves and their families rather than their disadvantaged citizens and orphans in this way.These future pillars are in danger and living in appalling circumstances.The country's prevalence of social problems is one of the main causes of everything.On the other hand, as he returns from such a horde (confusing location) of people dancing madly, parties, and ceremonies in big hotels and skyscrapers, he thinks back to the days when people were truly free.
%%In the third stanza, he softens up once more as he imagines a hopeless, depressed, and alone child who is always wearing a transistor around his neck and sobbing and looking for his mother.The child is in great fear.A man is brutally beaten in front of his family for no apparent reason.It asserts that people at this time are indifferent to one another and that dominance is king.The speaker rebels against the system as a result of these illegal actions.
%%The poet describes in the fourth stanza a man who is unable to speak because the powerful inhabitants of the night have silenced him, leaving him with a blood-stained shirt and bruised human lips.The game of hide-and-seek links the laborers and the landowners.
%%The speaker expresses his dissatisfaction with the words "not listened to" and "waiting for the storm for its Leela" in the fifth stanza of the play.
%%The writer communicates good affections for the occupants in the 6th verse by utilizing grown-up Irish blossoming plants over the stone, storms going to public spots, and the sun sparkling with fluctuated colors like a rainbow.Other metaphors, such as the "soft storm," "silent pages," "forlorn shirts," and "celebrations for the gods," etc., are in a state of chaos because they are under the control of the country's disturbing rulers.
%%In the seventh stanza, he discusses a variety of the things that have softened his heart, such as valuable items, modern men's indifference and self-centeredness, criminal acts, a disturbed and spoiled mother earth as a result of human wrongdoing, and the terrible lives of other helpless creatures.In the final line of the poem, the speaker emphasizes that he needs freedom not only for himself but also for all of this motherland's creatures.He favors the exquisite and serene sky and wishes to move uninhibitedly, liberated from social requirements, to the normal calming song of calm tempests and pleasant birds singing, in a circle that goes endlessly round.
%%   
%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. At what point does the speaker become soft?*Make use of the times when he becomes softer.
%%There are a few times when the speaker loses his voice.They are as follows:
%%When he returned from the melee, he saw a helpless child with a transistor radio around his neck, a blood-stained shirt, and so on. After hearing the commotion as the moon sang of lampposts and gutters in this seamless city. When homeless children in Thamel cried out for food.
%%b. What is meant by "this seamless city" to you?*
%% What I mean when I say "this seamless city" is a city where people can freely move around, without having to worry about social problems or disruptions, and enjoy the real benefits of happiness and freedom without bias.
%%c. Describe the plight of the poem's poor children.
%%Under the bat-bearing trees of Kesharmahal in Thamel, hungry, homeless, and without parents, children scream.They are denied the fundamental rights that are protected by the Constitution.
%%d. What do you think "the unwed gardens of history" mean to you?*
%%I understand that social and political hegemony has led to unresolved incidents in the past as well as a society that ignores its culture and traditions, resulting in a lawless and chaotic society in Nepal.
%%e. Why was the child sobbing hopelessly?*
%%The bereft child wailed for his mother to come out of the corridors of violent history.
%%f. What do you mean when you say "soft storm?*"
%%I understand Abhi Subedi's deeply troubling feelings as a result of a lawless society and the "soft storm," which Abhi Subedi combined to give his poem its title.When the word "soft" is used in conjunction with the word "storm," it refers to the chaotic times that the poet observes in contemporary society. While a storm typically refers to bad weather,
%%g. For what reason does the speaker call our time 'frantic time'?*
%%The speaker refers to the present era as "mad time" because it is not governed by the nation's laws or the constitution.He asserts that environmental degradation, favoritism, social and political inequality, and corruption are all prevalent in society.
%%h. In "hard times," what does the speaker want to do?*
%%The speaker wants to melt like a rainbow during "hard times."
%%a. The poet uses the word "soft" in conjunction with the terms "storm" and "gale," which typically refer to disorder and violence.What effect does the poet achieve by employing such obtuse language?*
%%An anomolous expression is one that is well-formed syntactically but meaningless semantically.In the poem, the terms "soft storm" and "softness rose like a gale" are unusual and contradictory.Using these terms, the poet creates a psychological effect.By connecting two opposing ideas, he can convey his troubled inner experience.
%%b. How does the speaker feel about the period he describes in the poem?*
%%The speaker is not as positive about time because he finds that no particular work is being done by humans at particular times.Since he sees a lot of strange things happening around him, he thinks the time is wrong.He is having trouble because society is completely out of control and in chaos.Consequently, the speaker of the poem views time negatively.
%%c. How does the speaker appear?*Does he rebel?*Why?*Why not?*
%%Yes, the speaker of the poem behaves like a rebel, but the poem does not explicitly depict his rebellious nature.The artist tracks down the general public in disarray, with individuals living in destitution, yearning, and debasement.He sees crying children who are homeless and starving.He sees people who treat each other cruelly and forget their history.He seems like a rebel because he challenges everything.
%%d. In your own words, describe the following stanza:*
%%Under the moon of history and dreams playing hide-and-seek in open museums of human times, I saw a blood-stained shirt speaking in the earth's ears with bruised human lips. This made me soft.
%%These lines are from the poem "Soft Storm" by Abhi Subedi's fourth stanza.The poet expresses his displeasure when he observes a person in poor health late at night in the given lines.
%%The poet uses these lines to describe a man who is unable to speak because the powerful inhabitants of the night have silenced him, leaving him with a blood-stained shirt and bruised human lips.Clouds occasionally obscure the moon of history and dreams, which is the history of human ambitions and achievements.A location with significant cultural and historical significance is illuminated by the moonlight as it rises.The game of hide-and-seek links the laborers and the landowners.
%%Beyond the text*%% a. Write an essay expressing your dissatisfaction with the current social, cultural, economic, and political issues in Nepal.
%%A significant portion of Nepal's population is unable to participate in political and public affairs, as well as achieve social and cultural equality, as a result of economic and social conditions, social stigma, and a lack of access to knowledge.
%%I oppose the inherently unstable competitive multiparty democratic system of government as well as the rule of law, human rights, and fundamental rights mentioned in the constitution, which are only referred to as independence and a free and fair judiciary due to the fact that these things are only reflected in documents rather than in people's day-to-day lives.People's rights and the constitution are being violated by political leaders, who are simply engaging in dirty politics.
%%Under the old caste system, Dalits are the most discriminated against and have limited economic opportunities in society.I have nothing at all to say about the country's current social system.In society, there is a lot of nepotism and favoritism, as well as widespread corruption.Even though the United Nations believes that poverty is rapidly decreasing in Nepal, a quarter of the population is still in poverty.I find it objectionable that today's society is plagued by gender inequality, discrimination against women, the trafficking of girls, violence against women, and a host of other issues.
%%b. Let's say you're a rebel who wants to change the society by getting rid of wrongdoings and oddities.Write a speech about your plan for change.
%%➜ Regarded honorable men and women, as well as my dearest companions I'm Himal Poudel, and today we've joined to stand in opposition to cultural misbehaviors and irregularities, and how they're impeding our nation's development.Racism, child abuse, and alcoholism are examples of widespread social wrongdoing in contemporary society.Caste, child labor, child marriage, illiteracy, gender inequality, superstitions, religious disagreements, and a host of other societal issues are just a few examples in Nepal.The majority of society members oppose social ills.
%%Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras were among the groups that our ancestors divided people into based on their occupations.Sudras suffer the most from oppression.They can't talk to anyone from any of the other three castes, and they can't even enter the temples.These were the adverse results.The second issue is child labor and child marriage.A child without education is similar to a bird without wings.If your child didn't get a good education, he or she would have a lot of problems in the world today.Everything is suitable at a certain age.Encourage your children to study until they are ready for work.Illiteracy is one of the socioeconomic issues.As educated individuals, we must educate the uninformed.
%%Poverty is a serious problem that must be solved right away.Destitution is brought about by ignorance, the station framework, and joblessness.The government ought to provide training to people who are unemployed.Sanitization and uncleanliness are two additional social vices.The negligence and laziness of individuals are to blame.To keep our nation clean, everyone must work.Discrimination against women and women's status have become commonplace.Both of these issues are caused by society's narrow worldview.These evils are all connected.The majority of our future people were stopped by them.We must acquire the appropriate ethical education in order to combat these social problems.
%%To address these issues, the government needs to work more efficiently.The public's education should be the first and most crucial step in addressing all issues.Our society still has a long way to go to eradicate a wide range of social problems.As Albert Einstein Said, "The world is a perilous spot to live, not in view of individuals who are detestable but since of individuals who fail to address it".This concludes my discussion.I want to express my sincere gratitude to each and every one of you and wish you the best in your endeavors to eradicate these social wrongdoings from society as soon as is humanly possible.
