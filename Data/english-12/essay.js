%%The main points:*
%%Oliver Sacks spent his childhood in a library with oak panels that belonged to his father, a Hebrew scholar who was a fan of the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen (1828–1966).Henrik Ibsen's plays, poems from his father's generation, and brothers' adventure and history books filled the entire library.He read The Jungle Book, a short story book by an English author named Rudyard Kipling.He enjoyed reading about Mowgli's adventures in the book.
%%His mother was also a voracious reader.As school awards, she had accumulated a library of literature books by American poet Emily Dickens, English writer Anthony Trollope, Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, Irish playwright Rudyard Kipling, English dramatist William Shakespeare, English poet John Milton, and poetry books.In addition, there were medical books in a particular cabinet in the surgery of his parents.He had a small lab, in addition to the most magnificent library, where he could immerse himself in books for hours, even forgetting to eat lunch or dinner.He first remembers going to the library and reading books when he was three or four years old.
%%He spent the most joyful hours of his adult life at London's Willesden Public Library, which is located in Willesden Green.There, he received his formal education.He was an active reader and self-learner, so formal schools made him dislike passive reading.He enjoyed reading any book he wanted in company of other readers and was a good library student.He began studying chemistry and astronomy as he got older.Since the Walker Library at St. Paul's School did exclude science books, he had the option to visit the Science Gallery's library with the assistance of his head master and learn science books there.
%%He visited the Bodleian Library and the Radcliffe Science Library while attending university.He made the decision to write a biography of Theodore Hook after reading about him.He wrote about himself in the Bodleian Library and gathered information from the British Museum Library.His favorite library was the Queen's College library in Oxford.He looked at ancient works like Gesner's Historiae Animalium (1551), Agassiz's books, Charles Darwin, Sir Thomas Browne, and Jonathan Swift, as well as works by Samuel Johnson, David Hume, Alexander Pope, and John Dryden from the 17th and 18th centuries.
%%He moved to New York City in 1965 and lived in a small apartment there.He did write some of his book Migraine, though it was hard for him to read and write in the apartment.He found that it was simple for him to read and write after he was accepted into Albert Einstein College of Medicine.He went to a second friend's house in search of the same 1890 book, Volumes of Brain.Reading and exchanging information helped him establish a strong connection.
%%Sitting at a table surrounded by mountains of books, he continued to visit libraries.He discovered in the 1990s that students were avoiding bookshelves in favor of using computers to access information.The college decided to get rid of the books because the majority of students were not using them.That took place in the AECOM Library as well as other libraries worldwide.Most of the books had been thrown away.He considered this to be a crime or a murder.It was the demise of centuries' worth of knowledge.Despite the fact that the most important books had been digitalized, the loss of books upset him.It's possible that digital literature won't inspire or delight in the same way.A few books are precious.Most libraries had special areas for old books in the 1960s.Megrim (1873), written by Edward Liveing, inspired him to begin writing.

%%Summary:*
%%The union of two spouses who are bound by traditional, legal, and moral obligations and have a variety of deep personal and social ties is known as marriage.It is a well-organized framework that works with other institutions like the family, the education system, the economy, the law, and politics.The relationship between couples is governed by rules in many ways, and they exist within soft borders to follow patterns.Marriage is recognized from any remaining sorts of associations by its delicate limits or allowed limits of conduct.Married couples are distinct from other partners thanks to the legal framework of marriage.They are a part of a larger system of well-known ideas that help people organize and keep their lives after marriage.
%%Marriage is extremely significant for men because it organizes their goals and gives their lives structure.Dr Stephen backs this contention with a statement from Emile Durkheim, a French humanist.Emile is of the opinion that marriage legitimizes demands for happiness, comfort, luxury, and prestige, which in turn prevents suicide.Married people have lower suicide rates than single people.Marriage helps men discover their life's purpose and helps them become better citizens.Unbounded longings and wants are constrained by marriage.A man's need for love and moral equilibrium is met when he marries the same woman for the rest of his life.Because of his marriage, he takes care of his responsibilities, limits his desires, and gives up other pleasures.
%%Cohabitation without a spouse, also known as living together, is becoming increasingly common.Cohabitation between people who are not married is known as unmarried cohabitation.It is growing because the partners can live a happy life without the constraints of marriage, without having to follow predetermined rules, with a great deal of freedom, and without being restricted by a wide range of laws and conventions.They do not adhere to traditional norms, such as behavioral restrictions, no commitment to one another, no identity, and no institutional relationship, so their relationship is not widely accepted or legal.A married couple is accepted by everyone because they follow patterns, rules, and customs as husband and wife.They joyfully declare their union as husband and wife.Conventions, religion, and laws all protect their relationship.
%%In addition, marriage is a source of social capital.It shows relationships among people.It establishes a connection between confidence and trustworthiness.The new connection is built on trust and faith.The husband and wife are introduced to new relationships.The relationship is important, and it needs help and support when it's needed.Social capital advantages people.People with high friendly capital are embedded into networks that work with the trading of esteemed information and data among all individuals.social sanctions and norms (like honor, position, etc.)backing such organizations by advancing a few exercises while restricting others.Marriage is a valuable individual asset, but because it is only a relationship, it is more difficult to maintain.
%%Due to its relaxed boundaries, marriage stands out qualitatively from other types of relationships.Because adult individuals have options in their spouses and heterosexual relationships, the numerous normative marriage rules define the relationship;The primary earners will be husbands, partners will be sexually committed to one another, and they will become legal parents to their children.Their relationship is protected by law, custom, and religion.It is a form of social control because of habits and goals that are appropriately channeled.Other people share a similar feeling.All other types of personal relationships pale in comparison to marital ones.

%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. The author asks, "What exactly is marriage?*"
%%The author asserts that marriage is the union of spouses who are bound together by legal, moral, and conventional presumptions and who have a variety of close personal relationships and associations.
%%b. In what ways are marriages an institution?*
%%Marriage is an institution because it is linked to other institutions like education, the economy, and politics and is recognized by law as a means of meeting social, economic, physical, and family needs.
%%c. What regulations govern a marriage?*
%%The many well-understood rules of marriage aid in the planning and upkeep of a spouse's life.
%%d. Why are men concerned about marriage?*
%%Men value marriage because it organizes their goals and ambitions and gives their lives structure.
%%e. Identify one of today's most pressing issues.*
%%One of the main problems with modern society is that people's seemingly endless desires for well-being, comfort, luxury, and prestige are constrained by a variety of legitimate boundaries.
%%f. What elements make up social capital?*
%%The vast network of people who are connected by a bond of trust and trustworthiness makes up social capital.
%%g. What is a typical marriage like?*Explain.
%%A marriage that is built on pre-established standards and values is known as a normative marriage.For instance, the following are the six characteristics of typical marriage in the United States:Mature, heterosexual adults who are willing to marry, husbands who are the primary earners, partners who are sexually faithful, and parents enter marriages.
%%Questions*
%%a. In light of the context, talk about the six aspects that make up typical marriage in the United States.*
%%Although the definition of marriage varies by location, marriage is universal.The marital customs and values of each civilization differ.Whatever it is, it gives two adults of different sexes the legal right to live together as life partners and fulfill each other's needs.In the United States, every marriage adheres to established norms and patterns in every region.The normative marriage, or structured marriage, has six dimensions in the United States.The fact that marriage is entirely voluntary should be mentioned first.You are not under any sort of obligation to get married.Individuals are responsible for making their own choices.Adults can lead their own marriages.The couple must be of the same sex in a heterosexual union.The spouse will be the essential worker after marriage.They have to provide for their families.When it comes to sexual activity, both spouses must be faithful to one another.Additionally, they do not have children until after they get married.
%%b. Are marriages different in different cultures?*How does your marriage differ from American marriage?*
%%Marriage practices vary from one culture to another and from one location to another.There are variations within a country as well as disparities across the country.Even within our nation, one region's marriage practices differ from those of other regions.However, the vast majority of Nepalese adhere to the Hindu faith.We are of the opinion that marriage is a social, spiritual, cultural, and legal union between a man and a woman who are married.Additionally, it marks the beginning of a connection between two families.
%%Because we adhere to Hindu tradition while the United States adheres to Christian tradition, our marriage practices differ from those in the United States.A religious figure officiates the wedding ceremony, which takes place in a religious building known as a church.The bride and groom swear their love and commitment to one another in church-provided vows.The attendees are questioned by the officiant regarding any arguments against the couple's marriage.The couple swaps rings to symbolize their unending love and devotion to one another if no one objects.The couple makes public their first declaration of marriage with their first kiss.
%%Beyond the text: *%%a. Write an essay about how marriage is done in your culture.*
%%The Practice of Marriage in My Culture:An essay is more than just two adult men and women committing their sexual desires to one another.Marriage is constantly changing.Gelation, which was once viewed as untouchable, is presently generally endured.For instance, our society already recognizes the legality of transgender marriage.There are various types of marriages in our societies, such as monogamy, which allows a single person to have only one partner;serial monogamy, in which one partner can remarry after the death or divorce of the other;polygamy, in which a single person can have multiple partners;polyandry, in which a single woman can have multiple husbands;polygyny, in which one man can have multiple wives;endogamy, which permits group marriage;and marriage, or exogamy, belongs to another group.
%%We adhere to our own set of marriage rules because I practice Hinduism.Instead of being a social contract, it is thought of as a religious sacrament.It is a socially accepted union between a mature man and woman for the purpose of having children, having fun, and meeting certain social obligations.The parties of a girl and a boy perform the engagement, a pre-marriage event.The potential partners exchange ring and garlands.To authorize this ceremony, a family priest recites mantras and performs rites.On that day, the wedding date is set.
%%On the day of the wedding, the bridegroom, along with his family, relatives, and neighbors, give speeches while dressed as the bridegroom and then head to the groom's house.A musician's band plays for the bridegroom's "Janti" party, which follows him.The "Saipata," a group of women carrying trays containing a variety of food items and gifts, leads Janti.With the assistance of family priests, the wedding ceremony takes place that day at the bride's residence.The groom's house is turned into a Mandap or Jagey, and the entire procession goes through there.The Pandit or Priest is the most important person who performs the rites.Janti and his neighbors will enjoy a lavish feast.
%%Around the sacred fire at the center of the Mandap, a number of actions are carried out in accordance with the priest's instructions:The bridegroom applies vermillion powder to the bride's head and places a holy necklace around the bride's neck are the primary actions. Additionally, the groom and bride circle the sacred fire seven times.A potent necklace and a vermillion powder known as "Sindur" are the primary omens of a married woman.The bride and groom's feet are washed by the bride's father, and everyone in attendance wishes them a happy marriage.The bride is scheduled to leave her family's home at the end of the day.The most touching scene is in this one.As they say their goodbyes to the bride, the majority of her family breaks down in tears.The bridegroom's home is where the newlyweds are greeted in accordance with welcoming culture.When they saw the new bridegroom's face, the crowd at the bridegroom's house stopped singing and dancing.Consequently, the couple begins their new life together.
%%b. Is marriage an institution of society?*Discuss.
%%The idea of marriage varies from person to person, depending on the person's philosophy and way of thinking.The term "marriage" is frequently used to refer to a legal partnership between two people of different sexes who have a personal relationship, residential cohabitation, economic cooperation, the formation of a nuclear family, the birth of children, and the fulfillment of a person's sexual needs.It is viewed as an organization since it complies with laid out regulation;patterns, norms, and customs that are important to society.Individuals lay out such organizations to legally fulfill their needs from different individuals, places, and items.Being accepted into society and adhering to social norms and values help people of all sexes meet their needs and goals.Marriage is common worldwide.Since the beginning of human civilization, every nation, society, and tribe has followed this custom.It will continue to exist until the end of human civilization and is eternal.Because the marriage system of the past and the marriage system of today are not the same, the term "marriage" is constantly changing.Kid marriage was once legal, however it is no more;Marriage between widows and transgender people is now legal.It is recognized by religion, the government, and other social organizations and grants children born outside of a married couple legal privileges like citizenship and birth certificates.

%%        Summary:*
%%In this essay, Russell makes a distinction between wisdom and knowledge.Knowledge and wisdom are distinct concepts.Russell provides a definition of wisdom and a number of approaches to achieving it.He laments the lack of a comparable increase in wisdom in spite of a wealth of information.He defines wisdom as the practical application and use of knowledge to produce value, while knowledge is the gathering of data and information.Wisdom comes from more than just memory; it also comes from study and actual experience.
%%By describing factors that contribute to wisdom, Russell defines wisdom.A sense of proportion is the first.It's the ability to analyze a problem's relevant variables in detail.It's hard because of specialization.For instance, scientists discover novel drugs without knowing how these drugs will affect people's lives.The medications might lower the mortality rate for newborns.However, it might lead to more people living there.Poorer nations may experience food shortages.A lower standard of living may result from an increase in population.The atom's composition could be used by a madman to destroy the world.Without insight, information can be risky.
%%The needs of humanity as a whole should be linked to knowledge.Knowledge that is comprehensive is insufficient.It ought to be connected to a particular comprehension of the purpose of life.This can be demonstrated with the assistance of history study.For instance, Hegel expounded on history with extraordinary verifiable information, yet he urged the Germans to feel that they were a predominant race.The war resulted from it.Consequently, it is essential to incorporate feelings and information.An illiterate man has knowledge but no feelings.
%%In both our public and private lives, we require wisdom.To determine our life's purpose, we need wisdom.We expect it to be devoid of personal prejudices.If a new idea is too big to accomplish, we might pursue it in an inappropriate manner.In search of the "philosopher's stone," also known as the "elixir of life," people have given up their lives.They weren't useful.They were looking for straightforward solutions to the complex problems facing humanity.A man may attempt the impossible, but in the process, he may put himself in danger.
%%In a similar vein, personal wisdom is required to avoid animosity.Two people may continue to be enemies due to their prejudice.A person might despise the other because of perceived flaws.If they are made aware that we all have flaws, they might become friends.Russel argues that reasoned argument can prevent hatred.Getting rid of our sense organs is the first step toward wisdom.Our senses help us develop our ego.The senses of sight, sound, and touch are essential to our existence.The primary means by which we perceive the world are our senses.We discover that there are other things as we grow up.They begin to appear to us.Consequently, we cease to view ourselves as individuals.We become wise when we start thinking about other people.We gave up our egotism.Although it is difficult to completely eradicate selfishness, we can consider our surroundings from a broader perspective.When we begin to value things that do not directly affect us, wisdom emerges.Wisdom begins when we begin to love other people.
%%Insight, as indicated by Russell, can be instructed as a point of schooling.We learn to love our neighbors, whether they are friends or foes, from the story of the Good Samaritan.Because we stop loving those who harm society, we frequently miss the point of this story.Only understanding, not hatred, will get you out.Russel basically tells us not to hate anyone.The author uses Queen Elizabeth I, Henry IV, and Abraham Lincoln as historical examples of notable people who avoided making the same mistakes in the past.The dangers of hatred and narrow-mindedness may be brought to light during education.Russel is of the opinion that an educational strategy can incorporate both knowledge and morals.Education should teach people to see things in relation to other parts of the world.They should be encouraged to think of themselves as citizens of the world.
%%The author then goes on to list five things that contribute to wisdom.These are the main ones:comprehensiveness, proportionality, emancipation, impartiality, understanding, and awareness of human needsWe become more evil as our knowledge expands.We would require increasingly more insight to utilize our insight.We need more wisdom to make the most of our growing knowledge.We won't be able to achieve our goals and fulfill our life's purpose until then.
%%      
%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. What factors are associated with wisdom?*
%%The following elements contribute to wisdom:
%%Comprehension, proportionality, emancipation, and impartiality are all aspects of comprehensiveness.
%%b. With the example of technicians, what message is the author attempting to convey?*
%%The author makes an effort to convey a message about harm by using technicians as an illustration.He is of the opinion that applying technical knowledge without wisdom could be detrimental to humanity.Technologists, for instance, may be pleased that the global infant mortality rate has decreased, but this results in a lack of food and a lower standard of living.Similarly, understanding atomic theory can be used to construct atomic bombs that will eradicate humanity.
%%c. According to Russell, which leaders were able to effectively combine knowledge and wisdom?*
%%According to Russell, leaders like Abraham Lincoln, Henry IV of France, and Queen Elizabeth I of England were able to successfully combine knowledge and wisdom.Both Sovereign Elizabeth I and Henry IV stayed clear of their time's deficiencies, and thusly, they were both kind and doubtlessly not fruitless.Similarly, Abraham Lincoln never strayed from the path of wisdom while leading a massive battle.
%%d. Why is wisdom necessary not only in public settings but also in private ones?*
%%Wisdom is required not only in public settings but also in private ones.Wisdom is required when choosing objectives and overcoming personal prejudice.Because we lack wisdom, we might not be able to choose the goal of our life and succeed.
%%e. According to Russell, what exactly is the purpose of education?*
%%Russell maintains that the true goal of education is to instill wisdom in individuals.Wisdom enables us to use our knowledge effectively in the real world without harming other people.Knowledge and wisdom must be combined for citizens to be good citizens.
%%f. Can wisdom be cultivated?*How, then?*
%%True, wisdom can be learned.Teaching wisdom ought to have a greater intellectual component than teaching morality.The devastating effects of hatred and narrow-mindedness can be mentioned incidentally while imparting knowledge to those who feel them.For instance, in addition to teaching about the atom's composition, it is necessary to teach about the devastating effects of its misuse, such as the creation of atomic weapons.
%%g. Why is there a future demand for more wisdom?*
%%In the future, the world will require more wisdom.It is abundantly clear that knowledge will continue to grow in the future when we examine the current state of knowledge in various fields.The majority of people misuse knowledge without wisdom, resulting in a variety of negative outcomes, and this trend will continue if knowledge is not combined with wisdom in the future.People can only make wise use of their knowledge with wisdom.For a brighter future, more wisdom is required.
%%Questions:*
%%a. Russel asserts, "Unless it is combined with wisdom," that "the pursuit of knowledge may become harmful."Justify your position.*
%%Russel states, "Unless it is combined with wisdom, the pursuit of knowledge may become harmful."The significance of integrating knowledge and wisdom is discussed in the essay "Knowledge and Wisdom" by Bertrand Russell.He examines the various ways to astuteness and how information without shrewdness can be perilous.
%%Russell underscores the worth of extensiveness while likewise expressing that breadth doesn't approach intelligence.Although Hegel's philosophy was extensive, it lacked knowledge and bias.Although Hegel wrote with a wealth of historical knowledge, he misled the Germans into thinking that they were the most powerful race in the world, which led to war.Knowledge and feelings must therefore be combined.Wisdom is lacking in men who lack emotion but possess knowledge.Both public and private life call for wisdom.
%%b. According to Russell, what exactly constitutes wisdom?*And how is the very essence obtained?*
%%The essence of wisdom, according to Russell, is to break free from the confines of the physical and emotional worlds and look beyond them.He thinks it's a bad idea to work toward goals that are impossible to achieve.He also says that knowledge comes from being free of personal prejudice, which makes one's thoughts and feelings less personal.
%%Wisdom is not always the result of knowledge.The practical application and use of knowledge to generate value, according to Russell, is wisdom.Instead of relying solely on memory, one can acquire the very essence of wisdom through learning and actual experience.
%%Beyond the text:*
%% a. Why is education dependent on wisdom?*Discuss.
%%Wisdom is the ability to think objectively and openly.As we mature, our feelings and thoughts become less intimate.It inspires us to use our knowledge in the right way.It enables us to benefit humanity by applying our knowledge.When we are wise, without ego, and without prejudice, we love even our enemies.Wisdom is an aspect of human life that goes beyond knowledge and education.A perfect being emerges when these two aspects are properly balanced.
%%The goal of education is not only to impart knowledge but also to produce outstanding citizens.Wisdom does not come naturally, and people who lack wisdom may misuse the information they have gained;It must be instructed.One of the educational objectives must be to cultivate students' wisdom, and it must be taught in schools.It must be instilled and nurtured in the mind by providing concrete examples.
%%b. How do you develop wisdom?*Do you think that the things you are doing in college help you become wise?*
%%The idea of wisdom is hard to put into words, but we all know it when we see it.Intelligent people remain calm during a crisis.They look into different points of view, are aware of their own limitations, and are aware that the world is always changing.
%%Wisdom comes slowly over time.Wisdom development requires both patience and self-control.Wise reasoning is linked to greater life satisfaction, fewer negative emotions, better relationships, and less depressive thinking.A wise person is prone to error.You improve by making your own errors.Realize that the more mistakes you make, the more you will grow and learn.A step toward becoming wiser is also maintaining a positive attitude.Whatever happens in your life, be blissful, faith in yourself, and conquer troubles calmly.A wise man doesn't worry about anything.He or she calmly resolves the issue.These, I accept, are the unequivocal ways to astuteness.

%%Summary:*
%%The essay Humility was written by the well-known Jerusalem essayist Yuval Noah Harari.He demonstrates humility in this essay by dispelling the misconceptions about human superiority and mastery.According to him, creativity, morality, spirituality, and art are universal human talents that are ingrained in our DNA.In this essay, which can be described as "a recognition of the real limits of our techno-social knowledge and ability," the author debunks humanity's illusions of superiority and mastery, demonstrating humility.Harari asserts that the majority of societies lack humility.The majority of people believe that their culture is the foundation of human history and that they are at the center of the universe.
%%Greeks believe that Homer, Sophocles, and Plato were the first people in history, and that Athens, Sparta, Alexandria, or Constantinople were the birthplaces of significant innovations.There is a widespread belief among Indians that ancient sages on the Indian subcontinent were the first to develop nuclear weapons and airplanes, let alone Einstein and the Wright brothers.
%%One of the world's three most prominent faiths, the Jews believe that they are the originators of monotheism.However, despite the fact that there are only 15 million Jews, there is no reason to believe that they are more significant than the Hindu religion, which has a significantly larger number of followers.Each group thinks that it is the center of the world and the one who came up with the most important ideas and things.
%%However, no group truly stands out;Before them, some version of their ideas and ideology existed.The faiths that made it through were the most aggressive, converting the most people to their beliefs.For instance, Jews claim that the biblical expression "love your neighbor as yourself" originated in China.
%%Similarly, monotheism did not begin as a Jewish religion but rather originated in Egypt.No one should be happy that monotheism was developed because it has resulted in global disaster.Even though many Jews continued to be persecuted a few centuries after Christianity's founding, Islam now considers all history prior to Mohammed to be meaningless.
%%According to Chinese nationalists, their culture is the source of many outstanding ideas.The Jews accept that they are God's picked individuals and that gentiles are not on pace with them concerning significance.Although some wise men have called for religious tolerance, the past has always been one of persecution of those who disagree with one's beliefs.Ironically, the majority of faiths warn against self-centeredness precisely because of this.
%%      
%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. Describe the assertion that the Chinese nationalists are making regarding human history.*
%%Chinese nationalists assert that the Yellow Emperor, the Xia, and Shang dynasties are where history began, and that anything Westerners, Muslims, or Indians accomplish is merely a pale imitation of genuine Chinese accomplishments.

%%Reference to the context* 
%% a. Compose a brief essay on The Conflicting History of Human Civilization.*
%%The Divergent Course of Human Civilization:An Essay When we talk about the history of human civilization, we always say that our own civilization was the first and most important.The cloak of dominion and supremacy over our own race covers us.The desire to be at the center of the universe is part of who we are.Humans from Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Maya, India, China, Rome, Greece, and Persia all share the same ego.The Abrahamic and Indian religions are examples of this.
%%Many Greeks believe that Athens, Sparta, Alexandria, or Constantinople were the first places in history.The Chinese refute this idea, recognizing that the Xia, Shan, and Yellow Emperors were the first rulers of China.Additionally, they hold the belief that Western, Indian, and Muslim innovations pale in comparison to Chinese innovations.Hindus assert that their civilization is responsible for all of today's breakthroughs in science.Rockets, missiles, and atomic theories were created by Indian subcontinental sages in ancient times.Muslims, on the other hand, hold that the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were the first.
%%Before Muhammad and the Quran, nationalists in Turkey, Iran, and Egypt claim that their nations were the source of Islam's purity and its keeper.The British, French, German, American, Russian, and Japanese all assert that they have liberated humanity from barbaric and immoral ignorance and that they have accomplished remarkable feats.The Aztecs are certain that their sacrifice is what keeps the universe from dissolving.Some of the most important innovations in the world are credited to Jews alone.Yoga poses are credited to Abraham alone.The Hebrew alphabet served as the basis for the creation of yoga poses.Indeed, even they accept that the investigation of consecrated compositions by Jewish rabbis is the essential justification for the universe's obliteration.
%%In point of fact, none of these assertions are true.Egoism and racism are the causes of these assertions.Instead, these religions or civilizations were the first to settle other parts of the world and raise animals and plants in their own homes.It is nothing more than gross egotism to attribute them to a more recent location and time period.Human creativity, spirituality, art, and morality are universal traits that are ingrained in our DNA.We don't like to be criticized for our own habits, culture, religion, or people.We instead praise them.We lack self-control.Human civilizations have conflict primarily because of this.
%%b. "Since it is more polite to criticize one's own people than to criticize foreigners," the author asserts.Do you concur with what he says?*Justify your position.
%%In his essay "Humility," Harari asserts that criticizing one's own people is more polite than criticizing foreigners.Since criticizing outsiders creates tension, I concur with his assertion.People are very preoccupied with their own civilization and history.They find it offensive when members of a different faith or community criticize their own.Everything that is said or written about our civilization, religion, and culture is accepted without question.What fools think is that the study of sacred texts and human sacrifice are necessary for the cosmos to exist.It is egotism to assert that religious texts and human sacrifice prevent the universe from being destroyed; nobody knows how long this universe has existed.Humans may have landed on the moon thousands of years ago if wise men had come up with rockets and missiles.It will result in conflict between two groups of people if we oppose such things and are foreigners.We must first identify the flaws in our culture before we can fix ourselves.

%%Summary:*
%%In "Basic freedoms and the Time of Imbalance," Samuel Moyn tends to the emotional bungle between the populist emergency and the common liberties arrangement, which requires an enhancement as opposed to a substitute.He asserts that both the human rights movement and the regime are simply ill-equipped to deal with global inequality.
%%Moyn begins the essay with a parable about Croesus, the last king of Lydia. He tells the story of a wealthy king who believed he was the happiest of mortals.He wanted his people to remain content and free of all suffering, but he had a problem: he didn't want to invest his money to alleviate their suffering.He had accumulated funds for himself, which the Persian king Cyrus the Great and his army later managed.shortly after his defeat.The writer connects what is going on with the cutting edge reality where imbalance exists and accessible means and assets are conveyed inconsistent, The essayist expresses that December 10 is praised as Common liberties Day each year' there is no any means sent for equivalent access of freedoms and property among rich and poor on the planet.There is only one way to get around all of these problems:distributive equality, but he finds that it is nearly impossible in real life.The author claims that there are two major stages involved in writing the history of political economy and human rights:
%%The initial period was the heroic era of national welfare states following World War II.
%%The second was the political economy climbed past the country during the 1940s.
%%In his State of the Union address, Franklin Roosevelt famously called for a "second Bill of Rights" that included socioeconomic protections, but he left out three crucial details:America's entry into the North Atlantic consensus as a province;promising to let go of need;and imagining it all over the world.After 19403, human rights suffered greatly due to favoritism and the subsequent cold war that divided the world into two groups—the US-led democratic nations and the USSR-led communist nations.In a similar vein, postwar decolonization could not bring about the desired development and protection of human rights among nations because these states favored "national welfare" over egalitarian human rights.
%%Samuel Moyn portrays an issue of regardless of whether another basic freedoms development is vital and afterward refers to the case of truth and reality referenced in Herodotus' set of experiences which managed the requirement for rearrangement of worldwide financial equity under the strain from the rich to poor.Despite the fact that advocates for human rights make the argument that human rights guarantee equal freedom and rights for all people in written documents, they are actually not used in the real world.Until and unless this current economy and sociopolitical structure exists, humans will not receive original, fruitful freedom and truthful rights.Therefore, for an egalitarian society, a fair portion of the wealth and property distribution from rich to poor, redistribution of means and resources, the formulation and implementation of laws for a fair wealth distribution by the government, and massive and radical movements are all necessary. However, all of these things are impractical, inapplicable, and extremely difficult to take place in practice.
%%Most importantly, our destiny is analogous to that of Croesus' world, where the rich, like the colonizers under British rule, enjoy happiness, freedom, and everything to the fullest, while the poor live in an illusion of equality and freedom.
      
%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. What was the first United Nations declaration on human rights?*
%%Mobilization for economic and social rights was the first United Nations human rights declaration.
%%b. When is the celebration of Human Rights Day?*
%%The date of Human Rights Day is December 10 each year.
%%c. What does the Universal Declaration of Human Rights aim to accomplish?*
%%The Universal Declaration of Human Rights aims to provide a list of the most fundamental rights and values, such as fairness, dignity, equality, and respect, that people are entitled to because they are human.In addition, it seeks to establish the "foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world."
%%d. When writing the history of human rights in relation to the history of political economy, what are the two major stages?*
%%Writing the history of human rights in relation to political economy involves two major stages:
%%After World War II, the heroic age of national welfare.
%%in 1948, the ferocious foes of the new cold war.
%%e. In Roosevelt's call for a "second Bill of Rights," what facts have been overlooked?*
%%Roosevelt's call for a "second Bill of Rights" misses the following facts:
%%First, it was America's typical tardy and timid entry into a North Atlantic consensus that had already been planned.
%%Second, his most important promise was the end of "special privileges for the few," or a ceiling on inequality, rather than a floor of protection for the masses.
%%Last but not least, Roosevelt had every right to hope that it would span the globe, but it was only organized nationally.
%%f. Write the truth that Herodotus tells in his stories.*
%%In Herodotus' Histories, the truth is that, like local socioeconomic justice, global socioeconomic justice would necessitate a redistribution driven by novel forms of legal activism from the wealthy to the poor.
%%g. What is the significance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to you?*
%%Because it eliminates partiality, injustice, inequality, discrimination, and other forms of discrimination from society, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is important to me because it promotes the rights, justice, equality, and equity of all human beings.
%%Refer to the Situation*
 %%a. Does the essay offer strategies for stigmatizing inequality?*Explain.
%%Although the essay "Human Rights and the Age of Inequality" discusses the stigmatization of inequality, it does not provide any specific suggestions for combating inequality.Ultimately, history suggests that they are not the right agents;not sufficiently scared to cause redistribution.Opponents will arise on occasion if inequality continues to rise in this way.As a result, ensuring social justice and equality is preferable.Social equality and liberation can be justified by starting a new kind of human rights movement for the benefit of the common people.Appropriate management and checking, backing of partners, ordering severe regulations, eliminating favoritism and keep up with equity and uniformity and so on.are vital for the helpful sake of the every individual.Because it causes friction and conflict among individuals, inequality is regarded as a stigma for society; consequently, it must be balanced appropriately.
%%b. Is a new movement for human rights required?*Why?*
%%Yes, another human rights movement is required because, as the essayist observes, human rights are constrained in human affairs by political suppression.For the following reasons, he anticipates another human rights movement in the coming days:
%%It is discovered that powerful individuals are breaking the law.
%%In human affairs, inequality has been contained.
%%Favoritism and nepotism continue to exist.
%%Law should take precedence.
%%Hegemony in politics and society persists worldwide.
%%Rights and laws are only written down, not put into practice.
%%All people, rich or poor, upper class or lower class, need rights and justice.
%%Beyond the text:*%% a. What obstacles hinder the upkeep of human rights in Nepal?*
%%The fundamental freedoms and rights that everyone has are known as human rights.The provisions that give human rights legal effect are contained in international law, which also includes treaties.
%%In Nepal, the Human Rights Commission Act of 1997 (2053 BS) established a statutory body to protect human rights in the year 2000.The in-between time Constitution of Nepal 2007 (2063 BS) made the NHRC a sacred body.
%%The following are the main obstacles to upholding human rights in Nepal:
%%Disparities in education, especially in rural areas, gender inequality in health care, violations of children's rights, nepotism, corruption, bribery, illiteracy, and people's ignorance Priority for personal gain or favor, a lack of a proper mechanism to systematize policies, a lack of effective strategies for enforcing the law, and other issues
