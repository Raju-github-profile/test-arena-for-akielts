%%Tim Winton, whose full name is Timothy John Winton, was born in 1960. He is an Australian author who has written books for adults and children about life in his home country as well as its landscape.In 1982, he won the Australian Literary Award for the best unpublished novel manuscript alongside 35 other novelists for his manuscript, An Open Swimmer.His books incorporate That Eye, the Sky (1986), Soil Music (2001), and Breath (2008).Lockie Leonard, Human Torpedo (1990), The Bugalugs Bum Thief (1991), and The Deep (1998) are among his numerous works for children.The story "Neighbours" is from Harwood Lawler's edited collection "Migrants of Australia."
%%Summary*:
%%The young couple who have just moved into a new house are the focus of the short story "Neighbours" by Tim Winton.They were initially uneasy due to the high concentration of immigrants in their neighborhood.
%%On the right, a Macedonian family was hollering and a Finish single man was beating nails into the wood.The young couple found it odd.On the other hand, the Macedonians found it odd that the young man wrote his thesis at home while his wife worked.In the autumn, when the young couple started planting vegetables and asked for help, things started to change.The young man tried to build a henhouse, but it didn't work out.
%%The widower from Poland rebuilt it without being invited.The young couple smiled back at their neighbors in the winter.In the spring, the Macedonian family taught them how to slaughter, and the couple found out that the woman was pregnant.
%%The young couple didn't tell each other about it, but the neighbors saw it.As they presented them with gifts, they were thrilled.The entire neighborhood came out to greet the young couple and wish them well when the baby was delivered.
%%The man started to cry at this point as he realized that he had been harboring prejudices all along.He was of the opinion that the process of writing his thesis had not adequately prepared him for life.
%%The main points*:
%%The story in Neighbours is about a newlywed couple who live in a multicultural and multilingual suburb.It demonstrates that people can show love and compassion despite differences in language and culture.
%%The young couple in Tim Winton's short story "Neighbours" have just moved to a new neighborhood with several European immigrants.Because they only see the strange and sometimes disgusting customs of their new neighborhood at first, the young couple and their neighbors have prejudices. However, after a while, they quickly adjust to their new surroundings, and the young couple begins to like their neighbors and realize that not all of them are bad.
%%They discover that they can be friends and that they can help one another out in their day-to-day lives, which makes everyone happy with their lives and neighborhood.
%%The characters mentioned in the narrative are not identified by the author.Because of this, the characters do not have a clear meaning, and as a result, they might be seen as examples for everyone.The young couple lived in the vast outer suburbs prior to moving.
%%First, they don't want to talk to anyone and act like they're strangers.The so-called "young man" stays at home and works on his thesis about how the book changed over time.Hospital employment is held by the "young woman."
%%After that, everyone in the neighborhood gets involved with them and offers to help.The young couple is therefore proud of their neighbors.The young woman becomes pregnant in the spring, despite the fact that the couple had no intention of having a child. Their neighbors soon learn of the pregnancy.Friendly and willing to help, everyone is there.
%%After the birth of their child, all of their neighbors are thrilled and wish them well.The young man finds out at the end that the twentieth-century book did not prepare him for the birth, which he views as a marvel.
%%As a result, Tim Winston's novel "Neighbours" demonstrates how immigrants can enrich Australia's social fabric.The couple is able to see that intolerance, prejudice, and discrimination all stem from ignorance thanks to their strong sense of community.
       

%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below*.
%%a. Describe the layout of the young couple's home.
%%Despite its small size, the young couple's home had the air of an elegant cottage thanks to its paned windows and high ceilings.From his study window, the young man could see the Moreton Bay figs in the park where they walked their dog and out over the rooftops and used car yards.
%%b. When the young couple first arrived, how did they identify their neighbors?*
%%When the young couple first arrived, they had a bad impression of their neighbors.They were irritated by many things.The toddler urinating in the street and looking at the fence came next, followed by the screams and cries of their neighbors.The young man also detested how the neighbors helped them with their gardening.The young man's wife's work outside while he was at home was frowned upon by their neighbors, who were also concerned about their dog, raised their eyebrows when they awoke late, and raised their eyebrows.
%%c. How did the young couple's neighbors assist them in the kitchen garden?*
%%The young couple removed trash from their backyard and ploughed and manured the soil in the fall under the watchful eye of their neighbors.They planted broad beans, leeks, onions, cabbage, and brussels sprouts, which prompted neighbors to approach the fence and offer advice on spacing, hilling, and mulching.Despite being irritated by the interruption, the young man paid close attention to what was being said.Additionally, the large woman holding a butcher's knife gave her a bag of garlic cloves to plant.The young couple's kitchen garden was helped by the neighbors in this way.
%%d. Why were the neighbors surprised by the young man's and his wife's role in their family?*
%%Due to the late hours at which the newcomers got up in the mornings, the locals were taken aback by the young man and his wife's role in the family.
%%The young man's decision to stay at home and write his thesis while his wife worked shocked even their neighbors.
%%e. How did the woman's neighbors react to her pregnancy?*
%%When they found out she was pregnant, the neighbors kept smiling at them.Because he did not smoke, the man in the deli presented her with small chocolate gifts and cigarettes in packages.
%%In the summer, Italian women started giving out names.A Greek woman stopped the young woman on the street, pulled her skirt up, felt her belly, and assured her it was a boy.By the end of the summer, the neighbor had knitted the baby a suit with booties and a beanie.The young woman was simultaneously elated, confined, grateful, and irritated.
%%f. At the story's conclusion, why did the young man begin to cry?*
%%The young man's beginning to cry at the end of the story is a sign of the young couple's realization after the baby was born.
%%It enables the couple to emotionally seek the support of their neighbors.Additionally, critical events like the introduction of a kid offer the capacity to acknowledge shared humankind.As stated in the required text, the infant had brand-new perceptions of the neighbors.
%%g. Why do you believe that the author did not use proper names to describe the characters in the story?*
%%➜ An individual's name is both significant and immaterial in a multi-social local area.It's important because, even if one doesn't live in their own country, everyone has a unique name.However, due to the fact that one's ethnic identity appears to be more significant than one's name, it is not as significant.
%%The creator should place the story in an overall class that alludes to comparable occasions.In addition, the author may wish to demonstrate that their individuality is less important than their ethnic affiliations.Lastly, Tim may not want his readers to become too invested in the characters because the story is short and he would rather show a live panorama of a mixed neighborhood.
%%Referring to the context* 
%%a. The story demonstrates that human relationships are unaffected by language and cultural barriers.Cite instances from the story where the neighbors overcame obstacles of this kind.
%%The young couple appeared to have learned to shout like their neighbors, despite the fact that they did not speak the same language and shared a similar culture. As a result, language and culture did not appear to play a role in their communication.The couple learned to blend in after some time of adjustment.For sure, the text demonstrates that the phonetic and social hindrances make no impediment in human connections.
%%The young couple's garden inspired their neighbors to approach the fence and offer advice on spacing, hilling, and mulching, according to the story.The couple decided to build a hen house. With the help of one of their neighbors, they finished it, making them finally equal to everyone else.Even at dinner parties, they started inviting one another.These are some of the story's best examples of neighbors breaking through such barriers.
%%b. "The twentieth-century novel had not prepared him for this" is the story's concluding line.What differences did the young man find between human relationships and novels from the 20th century, in your opinion?*
%%Even though the couple hadn't planned on having a child, the young woman gets pregnant in the spring, and their neighbors find out about it quickly.Friendly and willing to help, everyone is there.Their neighbors are all thrilled and wish them well after giving birth.The young man finds out in the end that the twentieth-century novel did not prepare him for the birth, which he views as a marvel.
%%In my opinion, one of the most significant distinctions that the young man discovered between human relationships and novels of the twentieth century is that, in contrast to the characters in novels, human beings must deal with and overcome a variety of astonishing and unpredictable circumstances throughout their lives.In reality, things don't go as smoothly as they do in the book.One must prepare themselves in ways that novels cannot teach in order to overcome these circumstances.
%%c. "Neighbors are companions for wedding procession as well as for funeral procession" is a proverb from Nepal.Does the story make use of this proverb?*Justify.
%%"Neighbors are companions for both the wedding and funeral procession."Yes, the story makes use of this proverb as well.
%%The neighbors came over to the fence and gave the young couple advice on spacing, hilling, and mulching when they first started growing a garden.In addition, the young couple exchanged vegetables with the neighbors.Additionally, one of their neighbors assisted them when they decided to construct a hen house.
%%They invited one another to dinner and talked about a lot of things.Also, everyone in the neighborhood was excited about the young woman's pregnancy.
%%d. In the story, the author addressed a multiculturalism issue.For what reason do you suppose multiculturalism has turned into a significant issue in the current world?*
%%The term "multiculturalism," also known as "ethnic diversity," refers to the diversity of a community's cultures.It is mostly used as a descriptive phrase to describe the demographics of a place, sometimes at the organizational level, such as schools, businesses, neighborhoods, cities, or nations.
%%I think multiculturalism has become a big problem in today's world because, in addition to bringing people from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds together, it also encourages a variety of social issues like failure to assimilate, ethnic segregation, and adaptation issues like high rates of crime, unemployment, and dropping out of school, among other things.
%%a. Write an essay about the celebration of childbirth in my community with references outside of the text.
%%The ritual or ceremony of celebrating the birth of a child with joy and happiness is known as childbirth celebration.The celebration of childbirth is marked by a variety of customs and rites in various communities.However, in my neighborhood, people used to congratulate new parents and family members at their homes.They also sing, dance, and eat delicious food to mark this auspicious occasion.
%%The community and friends celebrate the birth of a child each year with great pomp and circumstance.They would prepare various delicacies and present them to the elders, who are regarded as the custodians of our tradition, to make the birth of a child an unforgettable and joyful occasion.Additionally, they arrange small presents for the baby's mother and families.
%%During childbirth, mothers are treated with love and respect.During this time, they get the best care.To ward off evil spirits, a pregnant woman would light a diyo and let it flow into the river when she was ready to give birth.They would even perform "antihuman sacrifices" to safeguard the child.This is a custom to ensure the child's well-being.
%%b. Do the people in your community react in the same way to the pregnancy and birth as the story depicts?*Give a few illustrations.
%%Yes, the people in my community also react in a manner that is analogous to the story's depiction of pregnancy and childbirth.Community members, particularly women, will visit a pregnant woman at her home and talk about her condition after learning of her pregnancy.During this time, they also offer the woman guidance on how to take care of both her own health and the health of her child.
%%The families of pregnant women also receive clothing, chocolates, and gifts from the people in my neighborhood.They also come up with a lot of male and female names for the unborn child.

%%Summary:*
%%On their plantation, Mrs. Baroda discovers that her husband's friend Gouvernail is staying with them.She is dissatisfied by this because she had hoped for a break and they had been having a lot of fun.Despite hearing numerous positive things about the man, she had never met him.She immediately develops a romantic interest in him after seeing him.But she notices that he has a mystery about him that she can't explain but that she frequently tries to solve.She assures her husband that she will be better once he leaves because the man's visit is unlike any other, which bafflingly puzzles her.She decides not to return until he has left.
%%That evening, she sits on a bench outside and wonders why he makes her feel so uneasy.She is visited late at night by Gouvernail, who informs her that her husband gave him a scarf to give to her while she is away.After exchanging a few words, the two of them sat in silence.He begins talking, however she doesn't focus since her body is attracted to him.She wants to give her a hug, but she can't because she thinks she's "a respectable woman."Due to this sensation, she starts to move away from him.She eventually leaves and goes back to her house, debating whether to tell her husband.She also doesn't want to and goes to her bed.The following morning, she has left before the others have even gotten out of bed.
%%She comes back after Gouvernail has left, and at first, she doesn't like that he's back.However, to her husband's surprise, she supports his visit within a year.She simply states that she will treat him with respect and that she has overcome all obstacles.
%%The main points:
%%The plot of the short story "A Respectable Woman" centers on Mrs. Baroda's inner conflict as she becomes attracted to the friend of her husband.The conflict moves from exposition to rising action, climax, and conclusion in the manner of classical fiction.
%%Mrs. Baroda is initially dismayed to learn that her husband's friend Gouvernail plans to spend a week or two at their plantation. Mrs. Baroda had planned a time to rest and talk with her husband Gaston Baroda after they had been busy all winter.Despite the fact that she is aware that Gouvernail and her husband were friends in college and that he is now a journalist, she has never met him.
%%She initially has a negative mental image of him as a tall, thin, cynical man. However, she discovers that she likes Gouvernail, who is slim but neither tall nor cynical.Mrs. Baroda doesn't understand why she likes Gouvernail because she doesn't see all of his good qualities.He doesn't look smart, but he seems nice and quiet in response to her excitement to welcome him and her husband's hospitality.He doesn't try to impress her in any way, and he likes to sit on the portico and listen to Gaston talk about the sugar plantation. He doesn't like fishing or hunting, though.
%%Gouvernail intrigues her despite being charming and unobtrusive.At first, she leaves him alone with her husband; however, as she works to alleviate his anxiety, she begins to take him on walks with her.Her husband asks her why she doesn't want him to stay another week after telling her he will.When she says that she would like him to be more demanding, Gaston is overjoyed.
%%According to Mrs. Baroda, she anticipated Gouvernail to be more intriguing.She is informed by Gaston that he does not anticipate any disturbance as a result of his visit and that all he wants is a break from his busy life.She tells her husband that she might go to the city in the morning and stay with her aunt. Later that night, she sits by herself on a bench, confused and wanting to leave the plantation.
%%ouvernail sits next to her without noticing her discomfort at his presence.Gouvernail, speaking on Gaston's behalf, gives her a scarf and talks about the night. As he talks for the first time, his silence fades.He describes his childhood and his desire for tranquility to her.Despite her resistance because she is "a respectable woman," she considers drawing him closer because she is drawn to his voice more than his words.She eventually leaves, but Gouvernail stays to finish his evening's speech.She understands that she must deal with this emotion on her own, despite her desire to tell Gaston about her peculiar foolishness.
%%The following morning, Mrs. Baroda heads to the city and does not return until Gouvernail has left.Gaston asks Gouvernail to come back the following summer, but she says no.After that, she changes her mind, which surprised her husband. He tells her that Gouvernail didn't deserve her disapproval.She gives her husband a kiss and promises to treat him with more respect now that she has "overcome everything."
   
%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. Why did Mrs. Baroda find the information about Gouvernail's visit to their farm to be unsatisfactory?*
%%Because she had heard a lot about Gouvernail but had never met him, Mrs. Baroda was dissatisfied with the information about his visit to their farm.She was also dissatisfied because she had planned a time of relaxation and conversation with her husband, Gaston Baroda, after their hectic winter.
%%b. In what ways did Gouvernail deviate from what Mrs. Baroda had anticipated?*
%%Gouvernail did not live up to Mrs. Baroda's expectations. At first, Mrs. Baroda thought that Gouvernail was baffling and uninteresting, and that he was not the witty man her husband had told her about.She disliked him because she imagined him to be tall, thin, and cynical. He was wearing glasses and holding his hands in his pockets.However, she had a conversation with him one night on her plantation, which turned her dislike of him into a desire to connect with him.
%%c. Mrs. Baroda makes a comparison between Gouvernail and her husband.
%%Mrs. Baroda likes Gouvernail, but she doesn't think he has the same qualities as her husband.Her husband, Gaston, had frequently assured her that he possessed brilliant and promising qualities, but she could not locate any of them.
%%Even though he is courteous, Mrs. Baroda thinks that he is not as social as her husband because he doesn't seem to be paying attention to her.
%%d. Why and how did Mrs. Baroda attempt to alter Gouvernail's habit of being alone?*
%%Gouvernail was no longer interested in facts, so Mrs. Baroda tried to change his solitary behavior because she didn't anticipate a disturbance from his presence.She anticipated that he would be more intriguing.
%%By promising him that he would be more talkative and flexible to the situation, she attempted to change her solitary lifestyle.
%%e. In what way does Gaston disagree with his wife about the character of Gouvernail?*
Rather than agreeing with his wife that Gouvernail is a less interesting and reserved figure, Gaston points out that he is a remarkable, interesting, friendly, and talkative figure.
%%f. At the story's conclusion, Gaston is surprised by his wife's expression.
%%At the story's conclusion, Gaston is taken aback by his wife's surprise when she proposes on her own to have Gouvernail come back to them before the year is out, something he had never anticipated from her.
%%Reference to the specific situation*

%%a. What is the reason for struggle in Mrs Baroda's brain?*What role does Mrs. Baroda play in the story as "a respectable woman"?*
%%The primary source of Mrs. Baroda's conflict is her attraction to the friend of her husband.
%%Mrs. Baroda appears to be constrained by society's conception of what constitutes respectability.Mrs. Baroda seems to be drawn to Gouvernail, but she resists the urge to touch his face because she thinks she is a respectable woman and probably is afraid of what society might think of her.
%%b. Draw a sketch of Gouvernail's personality and compare it to Gaston's.
%%The short story "A Respectable Woman" reveals that Gouvernail is a journalist in the present.He isn't so friendly as his companion Gaston since he doesn't seem to give sufficient consideration to individuals around him.
%%Gaston is the only supporting character in the story.He describes his friend Gouvernail to his wife as "intelligent" and a "man of ideas," expressing his deep appreciation for him.By calling his wife "ma belle" or "chère amie," Gaston gives the impression that he is also in love with her.
%%c. Why does Mrs. Baroda not tell her husband about her feelings for Gouvernail?*
%%Mrs. Baroda doesn't tell her husband about her feelings for Gouvernail because she seems to be limited by what society thinks.Mrs. Baroda is well aware that society would consider her behavior to be inappropriate for a married woman.
%%Her feelings and desires are put ahead of her beliefs about what it means to be a respectable woman in society.Mrs. Baroda was unable to tell her husband about her feelings for Gouvernail due to her perception of herself as a respectable woman and her fear of what society might think of her.
%%d. The last three sentences of the story bring a sort of contort.How do you think Mrs. Baroda feels about Gouvernail after reading these three sentences?*
%%The story "A Respectable Woman" takes a different turn in the last three sentences.In the last three sentences, the story has shown a sudden shift in Mrs. Barods' inner character and way of thinking.
%%Not only has Mrs. Baroda changed her mind about Gouvernail, but she may also no longer have to conform to what society considers to be a respectable woman.Mrs. Baroda has transcended social boundaries to achieve freedom.By telling Gaston, "I shall be very nice to him (Gouvernail)," we can infer that Mrs. Baroda has not only overcome her own and society's perceptions of what a respectable woman is, but she is also prepared to pursue a relationship with Gouvernail.
%%Beyond the text: a. The introduction of an outsider into a family has been a common theme in literature and movies.Tell a story, real or imagined, in which an outsider destroys the intimate relationship between a husband and wife and causes the marriage to end without anyone being directly responsible.This topic is explored in the story "About Love" by Anton Chekhov.
%%The story "About Love" by Anton Chekhov is interesting because the arrival of Alyohin in Mr. Luganovich's family destroys the intimate relationship between the husband and wife and causes his wife Anna Luganovich terrible problems and mental stress.
%%Anna and Mr. Luganovich are married and live in the city together.The husband and wife are content to be together, despite the significant age gap between them.Anna is actually a young woman of about 22 years old.She is married to a judge who is over 40 years old.She is a young woman who is captivating, kind, beautiful, and intelligent.Anyone will be impressed by her gaze, beautiful and delicate hands, walking style, voice, and hairstyle.She has one child who is six months old when the story begins, and she later has another child.She and her husband have been living together peacefully and happily.However, the introduction of a second man to her life completely alters her life.In the end, she must leave Alyohin because she has a neurotic problem.The same thing takes place when Gouvernail joins Baroda's family in "A Respectable Woman."In the previous story, Anna passes on the city for Crimea to feel loose and revived and here in this story, Mrs Baroda leaves the ranch for her Auntie Octavie's with the goal that she can get loose and invigorated from her psychological pressure.
%%b. Before even meeting Gouvernail, Mrs. Baroda has expectations about him.Imagine that you are a mature girl or boy and that members of your family are putting pressure on you to get married.Describe in approximately 200 words the characteristics you hope to find in your future spouse.
%%Marriage is a lifelong choice.That is the reason one ought to never hurry to this stage until he/she is completely certain about soul mate.If not, it might be the mistake of a lifetime.Life and death are at stake.Before making a decision about who to marry, one ought to give their decision-making much thought.Because it contains a large number of pages, paragraphs, sentences, and words, it is not the same as judging a book by its cover.I hope my future spouse will possess the following characteristics:
%%To show his or her love and care, they have good manners.
%%S/he enjoys my company and comprehends and respects my decision as well. S/he admits his shortcomings and accepts my follies (Good Listener).
%%S/he is aware of my preferences and birthday, and on occasion, he or she will remember to surprise me with small gifts.
%%S/he is sweet and funny in a good way.
%%He or she never restricts our relationship or me.
%%He or she truly loves me and has respect for my friends and family.
%%He or she can meet challenges while maintaining a work-family balance.
%%S/he is autonomous both monetarily and inwardly.

%%Summary:*
%%Anita Desai is a notable Indian creator.She has written several novels in English.Pretty much every story she composes is about regular Indian life and people.A Devoted Son is a brief story about the bond between a father and son.
%%Dr. Rakesh is the focus of the narrative.He comes from a low-income Indian village.His father, Varma, sold vegetables.His father wanted a son with a good education.Rakesh is the family's first college graduate.We should rejoice that Rakesh passed his medical exams with the highest scores in the nation.Rakesh's grades and how he can now attend medical school in the United States are discussed by Varma to anyone who would pay attention.Certain individuals are scared that Rakesh would fail to remember his underlying foundations.Varma is pleased that everyone knows his son's name and is unconcerned about this.

%%The main points:
%%The novel "A Devoted Son" by Anita Desai is about the changing dynamics in the father-son relationship between Varma and Dr. Rakesh. It is a story about complicated family ties.It all comes down to the duty and love that Rakesh, the son, has for his parents.The son is raised by his father, begins working for money, and then faithfully takes care of his father.However, a crisis arises when his aging father begins to misinterpret his son's treatment.
%%Rakesh was a son born to parents who were illiterate.Varma, his father, worked as a kerosene vendor and dreamed for a long time of having a son who was educated.Rakesh was quick to get training in his age and he oversaw it well overall.When Rakesh passed his medical exam with the highest grade (flying colors) in the nation, the village felt proud.Presents from Varmaji's father's party included garlands, halwa, party attire, fountain pens, and even one or two watches.Rakesh went to the United States of America after winning a scholarship (Varmaji didn't know the difference between the United States and America), where he worked in some of the country's most prestigious hospitals.Rakesh loved America, but he loved his family more. Because of this, he returned to his village with a lot of money and touched his father's feet, which made the kerosene vendor proud.He got married to an Indian girl, which allayed the villagers' fears about marrying a foreigner.However, he wed a girl of their choosing who lacked education.They soon had a son thanks to the girl's good nature as well.
%%Rakesh's rise continued, and he soon rose to the position of Director of the city hospital, the top administrative position, bought a car, and opened a private clinic as well.It marked the start of his fortune.He took good care of his parents, though.He was a great doctor in addition to obeying his parents, making fun of his wife, hosting his friends, and enjoying his name and fame.
%%Rakesh's joyride, on the other hand, was cut short when his mother passed away, leaving his father mentally and physically ill and weak.When he learned that his father was close to passing away, his son's birthday party was canceled.Then, after returning from the clinic, he alters his schedule, brings his father morning tea, reads the newspaper, and visits him.All of these didn't make the father happy, and the situation got worse when Rakesh started to control his diet by cutting out oily fried food and sweets. This worried the father, who saw these actions toward his son as disrespect, strictness, and abuse.His dad whined to his neighbors that Rakesh was severe in regards to his wellbeing.The elderly man even used sweets to bribe his grandson.
%%The father-son relationship degenerated into chaos.The elderly man started to despise both his son and his daughter-in-law.Rakesh's wife avoided conflict with tact, and Rakesh also interpreted everything incorrectly.His numerous efforts to improve his father's mental and physical well-being were fruitless.Varmaji declared with determination that he did not require the medication for his son.Death was all he wanted to do.
%%Above all else, aging is cyclical, and we all will one day be in its shoes.Another name for it is the second childhood.Rakesh's father acted in this manner as a result.We may become aware of the reality of this life by recalling this fact.Despite everything else, Rakesh knew this, making him stand out from the crowd.

%%In his final years, Rakesh would have treated his father with more respect and politeness.

%%Beyond the text, make a reference a. Write an essay about the ambition of parents in Nepali society for their children.At least five examples are required.
%%A vast network of extended relationships is referred to as a family.In Nepali society, parents have high aspirations for their children.The majority of parents are predisposed and preoccupied with preconceptions that their children will be the best members of society—best doctors, best engineers, best teachers, and so on.Some situations elicit these thoughts:
%%Some children put in a lot of effort to reach their goals and ended up succeeding because of their parents' ambition for their children.
%%Parents can help their children achieve success in life and act as facilitators and guides by pointing them in the right direction.
%%Every parent hopes that their child will become the group's brightest star.Sometimes, they encourage their children to succeed and improve their lives by pushing them.
%%When parents decide their children's futures, it sometimes doesn't show how good they are, and it can also destroy lives.As a result, parents should also pay attention to their children's voices and goals in order to benefit them in the future.

%%Eat a lot of colorful fruits and vegetables, such as oranges, pineapples, and carrots, as well as vegetables like sweet potatoes and pumpkin.
%%Eat cereals, bread, wafers, rice or pasta consistently generally high fiber assortments.
%%Vitamin D-fortified low-fat or fat-free dairy products like milk or cheese can help maintain healthy bones.
%%Use olive oil or mustard oil as a cooking medium to lower blood cholesterol and increase good cholesterol.
%%Protein from egg whites is useful for repairing damaged tissues and cells.
%%Vegetable soups without cream or other thickeners are a healthy dinner option.
%%To avoid becoming dehydrated, especially during the summer, drink between 10 and 15 glasses of water each day.
%%In addition, regular exercise, stretching, and yoga will help nutrients be properly absorbed.

%%c. Write a 300-word essay about "Care of Elderly Citizens."
%%Care for the Elderly The term "elderly citizen" refers to people who are over the age of middle age.The final stage of human life is old age.A person requires proper elderly care and love during this time.There aren't many things an elderly person needs.He or she only needs a little love, attention, and a cozy home to spend their final years.
%%Elders have contributed significantly to the creation and development of our lives and careers for a significant portion of their lives; consequently, it is our duty to repay them in their later years.Tragically, in this day and age, some adolescent disregard their obligation towards their folks.They are seen disregarding their moral responsibilities to elders.Because they are unable to comprehend the significance of elderly care, they prefer to place their parents in nursing homes rather than taking care of them as they age.Instead of living with their parents, they would rather be independent.Our society should not take this as a positive sign.Being social animals, we must be able to care for the elderly.They ought to be familiar with how to care for their aging parents.
%%In point of fact, aging is a natural process.People require the utmost love and care as they age.Elderly caregiving is not only a responsibility but also a moral obligation.Family members are made up of elderly people.They have a good understanding of life's challenges.Life, it is said, teaches us lessons.We learn from elders how to develop, how to survive, and how to shape our future.They put a lot of effort into establishing us in this world.We are obligated to repay them in their later years.

%%The Forest's Hidden Treasure:Evans and Hooker are characters:two friends embark on a risky excursion to a tropical island in search of treasure.
%%A Chinese man named Chang-hi possesses a treasure map.
%%Short Summary: Chang-hi's coworkers are two additional Chinese men.
%%In the ominous adventure story "The Treasure in the Forest," two men search for Spanish treasure while letting greed take over their awareness.as the narrative progresses to demonstrate how greed and power corrupt individuals.
%%The main point of The Treasure in the Forest is that we shouldn't take chances when we're not prepared.In an unfamiliar wilderness, the two Englishmen took risks and were promptly killed.This tale concerned two Englishmen who acquired a map from a Chinese after learning about gold on an island.After falling asleep on the boat, they took a canoe to the island.Following the chart, they successfully drove their boat into a lagoon and up a forest river to reach their destination.They were terrified and began to worry about their safety when they learned that the Chinese with whom they had spoken had passed away, but nothing happened.Evans was punctured by the gold while they were packing it.Evans tried to forget about it, but the fatal puncture nearly killed him.Hooker, the other man, was urged to throw away the bad gold by Evans.Hooker, on the other hand, accidentally touched the gold because he was afraid and didn't even understand what his friend was saying.Both men perished in the end.
%%This storey does a good job of describing the awful situation they were in when they faced the danger, and the result of taking the risk will draw attention to other people.
%%The main points:
%%The third-person narrative of The Treasure in the Forest is a suspenseful thriller about Evans and Hooker, two treasure hunters, who murder a Chinese man and steal his treasure map, which finds a hidden stash of gold ingots (blocks of several valuable things).
%%After paddling all night in a canoe from the mainland through the sea in search of Spanish treasure, Evans and Hooker, the two main characters, were heading toward a coral island in the noon sun.
%%The narrator tells Hooker that they stole the treasures from a Chinaman named Chang-hi and killed him during the theft. Hooker is looking at a map of the treasures.Chang-hello had by chance found the fortune abandoned by a wrecked A Spanish vessel (transport), and had chosen to rebury it somewhere else, at an area uncovered by his guide.They appear to have run out of food and are extremely tired.They look at the map and are taken aback by the dashes it shows.After finding the location shown on the map, Evans and Hooker beach their canoe and paddle into the island's interior through the forest.
%%Evans drifts off while Hooker is sailing the boat and dreams he saw a small fire with three Chinese people sitting around it.They were discussing the Spanish treasure that a Chinese man named Chang-hi had retrieved from a shipwreck on an island and wanted to take with him.They brutally kill a Chinese man named Chang-hi and steal the treasure map.He looks at them with a grin when Chang-hi is killed.They travel toward the coral island by canoe.However, neither of them comprehends its purpose.They follow the map and soon find a forest and a similar-looking stone pile.However, alongside the purple and swollen body, they discover a bruised corpse of a man. They believe this to be a Chang-hi employee who chose to take advantage of the situation after spotting a hole in the ground and some gold.
%%In Evans' jacket, the two men carry as much gold as they can back to the canoe. After about a hundred yards, Evans' arms start to hurt, and he eventually passes out.After Evans's collapse, Hooker rearranged the ingots on the jacket and felt a pinch himself. At long last, Hooker realized what Chang-hi meant by his grin."similar to those the Dyaks poison (native Borneo groups that blow pipe with lethal poison at its tip) and use in their blowing tubes," Chang-hi had covered his treasure with thorns.The narrative comes to a close with Hooker lying dead next to his companion's "still quivering" body.
 

%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. Describe the story's expository scene.*
%%The story begins with Evans and Hooker, two treasure hunters, in a canoe approaching the land, a small river leading to the sea, a thicker, greener forest, a sloppy hill, and the sea.
%%b. How do Evan and Hooker interpret the map and what it looks like?*
%%➜ The guide seems as though a harsh guide, wrinkled and worn to the pitch of partition.Hooker sees the dotted line, straight line, and route to the lagoon in the map, while Evan sees the twisting lines as the river and the star as the location.
%%c. How did Evan and Whore be aware of the fortune?*
%%Through the Chinese man's conversation and the map he possessed, Evan and Hooker learned about the treasure.
%%d. Talk about Evan's dream.*
%%Evan had a dream about Chang-hi and the treasure.They were in the forest in the dream when they saw a small fire where three Chinese men sat and spoke quietly in English.Evans got closer and realized that Chang-hi had carefully concealed the gold on the island after stealing it from a Spanish galleon that had capsized.He worked alone and kept it a secret, but now he needs assistance to retrieve the gold.Chang-hi was brutally killed by them during a battle.
%%e. When the two treasure hunters approach the island, what do they see?*

%%h. How did Hooker and Evan become poisoned?*
%%Hooker and Evan were poisoned when a two-inch-thin, slender thorn pricked Hooker's thumb. Evan rolled over Hooker, and the two of them fell to the ground together, suffering greatly.
%%a. How do you know that the story takes place on a tropical island?*
%%➜ The story "The Fortunes in the Backwoods" has been set on a tropical island.After paddling all night from the mainland, Evans and Hooker paddle in a canoe towards a coral island in the heat of the noon sun.
%%There are tropical rainforests, grass savannahs, open woodlands, freshwater lakes and streams, salt marshes and mudflats (wetland), mangrove and coastal forests, sefis, fringing and offshore coral reefs, and deep sea on these tropical islands.
%%The narrative begins with a canoe approaching land and continues with the setting of the bay, the white reef surf, the litter river that runs to the sea, the virgin forest, the sloppy hill, and so forth.The atmosphere, ecosystems, thicker, greener forest, freshwater stream, coastal forest, palm trees, thorny bushes, seagrass, and depth sea all help the reader understand that the story takes place on a tropical island.
%%b. Why do you believe Evan and Hooker took the risk of finding the lost treasure on an island in the middle of nowhere?*
%%I believe that the following factors led Evan and Hooker to take such a risk when they discovered the buried treasure on a desert island:
%%People learn new skills and improve existing ones through treasure hunts, such as leadership, communication, and problem-solving.
%%Employers and employees alike will benefit from this.
%%It improves one's capacity to deal with challenging situations.
%%They view taking risks as beneficial.
%%Gold, it is said, "drives people crazy" to try new things.
%%Additionally, it reveals their lust for wealth.
%%c. Do you believe that the story's narrator is racist?*If so, what made him think he was better than other races?*
%%Yes, when the story's narrator talks, I get a sense that he or she is racist.as superior to that of the Chinese man in the story's Evan and Hooker.In point of fact, a racist is someone who views others with hostility or prejudice based on their affiliation with a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is underrepresented or underserved.In the story, we find the Chinese man was fiercely killed by Evans and Whore.Evans was asked by Hooker, "Have you lost your wit?*"It also demonstrates Hooker's power over Ivan.As a result, the narrative frequently asserts that the narrator resembles a racist.
%%d. Do you believe the story has a moral?*
%%The lesson of "The Treasure in the Forest" is that "the more they desire for greed and power, the more they become selfish."As they learn of the treasures, Evans and Hooker's greed grows.They brutally killed the Chinese man Chiang-hi and used the map to go in search of treasure.
%%Greed is the disordered desire for more than is decent, at the expense of others and society as a whole and not for the greater good.Voracity can be for everything except is most normally for cash or fortunes and influence is significantly more perilous and it can prompt somebody's demise also which we track down in the story.
%%Beyond what is written:*%% a. Perceive the story as a mystery.*
%%"The Treasures in the Forest" by H.G. Wells is a mystery story about two wastrels, a Chinese man's dead body, and thorns that make Hooker's thumb bloody.It conveys numerous emotional cases, for example,
%%Evans and Hooker, two treasure hunters, attempt to uncover the forest's hidden treasures in the narrative.
%%In order to steal the treasure map, Hooker murdered Chang-hi, a Chinese man.When he is killed, Chang-hi smiles at them.
%%They travel toward the coral island by canoe.However, neither of them comprehends its purpose.
%%They follow the map and soon find a forest and a similar-looking stone pile.The Chinese man's body is then discovered, though.
%%Evans begins to pick them up back in the canoe as soon as they see the gold, but both of them suffer greatly.
%%After that, Hooker realizes what Chang-hi meant by his grin.
%%As a result, it is a mystery tale.
%%b. Treasure hunting is a popular topic in children's literature.Compare and contrast "The Treasure in the Forest" with a treasure-hunting tale you read as a child.
%%I've read Edgar Allan Poe's "The Gold Bug," a tale about finding treasure.
%%Stories of suspense include "The Gold Bug" and "The Treasures in the Forest."
%%William Legrand goes treasure hunting on a remote island in South Carolina in "The Gold Bug," and Evans and Hooker go treasure hunting on an unnamed tropical island in "The Treasure in the Forest."
%%In neither of the narratives, the narrator is identified.
The island is marshy, with thick myrtle shrubs, among other things.in both narratives.
In The Gold Bug, the characters estimate that the treasure's total value is approximately one and a half million dollars; however, in The Treasures in the Forest, they transport the treasures in a canoe.
The Gold Bug makes use of the pet dog, and The Treasures in the Forest makes use of the map.
The themes of wealth and fortune are addressed in The Gold Bug, while the themes of greed and power are presented in The Treasures in the Forest.

    Brief Summary:
%%The narrator's hometown of a small village in China is the setting for the story "My Old Home."He returns to the house where he grew up.Even though his hometown hasn't changed much, it's not as bad as it used to be.He is returning to his previous residence primarily to say goodbye to his family and relocate them to a different workplace.While he is there, he experiences numerous childhood memories.He thinks back on the strong bond he had with Runtu, but it only lasted a short time.Runtu evokes fond memories in him.The narrator first met Runtu when he was just over ten years old.His family had to oversee a significant ancestral sacrifice that year.The conciliatory vessels must be protected.After the narrator's father granted permission, Runtu was given the responsibility of looking after the vessels used in sacrifices.He was overjoyed because he had known Runtu for a long time and was aware that he was about his age.
%%The narrator meets Mrs. Yang, who used to shop at the beancurd shop almost every day.She was once referred to as Beancurd Beauty by everyone.After that, Runtu shows up to see the narrator.He is now twice as big as he was before.He behaves as though the narrator is his superior and master.Runtu, a poor man, is encountered by the narrator and his mother.His mother suggests, after he has left, that they should give him what they won't take away so he can choose for himself.That afternoon, he chooses two long tables, four chairs, an incense burner, candlesticks, and one balance.Additionally, he requests that all stove ashes be removed.The narrator moves out of his old house at the end of the storey with his nephew and mother.He finds out that his past home and all of his memories are being destroyed.
%%The main points:
%%Lu Xun's "My Old Home" is an autobiographical novel about the author's character, Lu Xun, and his memories of growing up in his wonderful home as a child.He couldn't put into words how much he adored it and how proud he was to have been raised there.The story extends the contention among memories and real factors.
%%The narrator returns to his Old Home in 1911, twenty years after the Qin Dynasty was overthrown;At first, he can't believe his eyes.His earliest memories are represented here by his Old House as a symbol.His mother and nephew greet him.He finds his house in a ruined state after twenty years of weather, renovations, and other families. So many changes have been made, but not in good ways.Lu Xun makes amends with his family, including Mrs. Yang, a neighbor who had said that he was mean.When the bean curd lady says that Xun is being mean because he doesn't want to give away his furniture, Xun feels embarrassed.As he confronts the realities of his home town, his preconceived notions clash.
%%He learns that Lu and his old friend Runtu will be meeting up at the house.He recalls his brief relationship with Runtu, a boy who worked part-time as a laborer and was his childhood friend.They had a lively, upbeat, and brotherly friendship.It was fun for them to talk about how to catch animals like Badgers.Zha and Hedgehogs.Their concern for the outside world was less acute.
%%After 30 years, Runtu became much more mature as time went on and people changed. He had a hard life because of high taxes, social responsibilities, famines, bandits, officials, and landed gentry.Runtu has viewed the narrator in a different light as a result of these factors.Due to Lu Xun's higher social status, Runtu does not treat Xun as a friend but rather as an inferior acquaintance.The first thing Runtu says upon entering is "Hello Master."This is when Lu realizes that Runtu was more of a servant than a friend, even though Lu thought they were friends.Runtu behaves as though the narrator is his master and of higher rank than he is.
%%Last but not least, Lu hopes that his children will not discover the class distinctions that exist in China and that they will not drift apart, harming their friendship.Xun hopes that his nephew will maintain their friendship.He hoped that Runtu's social obligations would not affect them both.
%%The story ends with the message that as one moves on to better opportunities and places, they remember the memories that lie behind them.Through Runtu's cautious persona, Xun demonstrates the significance of loyalty.If someone only cares about themselves and their wealth, the friendship will end.The difficulties they encounter alter their friendship.They can't be friends because of what society says.It is impossible for people of different classes to interact and form relationships with one another.In some positions, they are required to perform their duties.
%%My First Home:A glossary of terms:rationalize (v.) the traditional Chinese unit of distance, which is 1,640 feet:Even if these aren't appropriate vessels for sacrifice, try to explain or justify with logical justifications:originally used as a meat cooker and storage vessel.The prototype made by Shang has a round bowl that is supported on three legs by two short handles on each side that are intercalary (n):a day or month added to the calendar to align it with the solar calendar, such as the 29th of February talisman (n.):an inscribed stone or ring that is believed to have magical properties and to bring luck hedgehog (n.):a small Old World nighttime mammal with short legs, a spiny coat, and the ability to roll into a ball for defense Concubine (n.):mistress;a woman who shares a home with a man but does not have the same status as him or his wife treadmill (adj.):monotonous or exhausting, with no reward stupefied (adj.):astonished, dumbfounded (ad.):exhibiting or feeling extreme shock, surprise, or awe

%%b. In what ways does the story back up the idea that childhood relationships are innocent, impartial, and uninterested?*
%%The narrative of "My Old Home" lends credence to the idea that childhood relationships are innocent, impartial, and uninterested.The narrator, Lu Xun, and Runtu had a childhood friendship when there were no class differences, rather they developed an innocent relationship. As the story progresses, we learn this.
%%The simplicity of children, their lack of knowledge, and their purity that have not yet been tainted by routine (boring) activities are all examples of the concept of innocence.Children see this kind of innocence as the promise of a new world.They shared the same innocence when they were children, when they would play together and stab Zha, badger, and porcupines.In the watermelon field, they flit from place to place.They had relationships with masters and part-time employees.They did not act in a selfish way.Their relationship and friendship were honest, fair, and uninterested.The same kind of relationships that the narrator wants to see between his nephew and Runtu's son.
%%c. After reading the story, what conclusions can you draw about the current economic and social structure of China?*
%%After reading the story "My Old Home," we can draw the following conclusions about the current economic and social structure of China:
%%The story shows how the peasant community in China at the time had complicated relationships.
%%It discusses the peasants' actual physical suffering as a result of economic exploitation and identifies the underlying causes of their miserable lives.
%%It reveals how miserable the peasants' mentality was after they had been poisoned for a long time by ideas of the feudal era.
%%Runtu, for instance, is a memorable and tragic individual who endured a lot of hard work and subsistence living.
%%It demonstrates China's class system, slavery system, and hierarchy by describing three types of servants, such as Yearlongs:those who work year-round for a single family; short-time workers:people who work during the day and busy-month people:those who cultivate their own land but only work for a particular family during the holidays or when they are paying rent.
%%Above all else, society dictates that they cannot be friends.It is impossible for people of different classes to interact and form relationships with one another.At certain positions, they are required to perform their duties.
%%d. What clues does the narrative provide about the local geography of the narrator's hometown?*
%%Geographically, the story "My Old Home" takes place in the narrator's hometown in 1911, when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown.The narrative began in the dead of winter, with a cloudy sky and a bitter wind.Through the window, the narrator sees towns and villages against a vast, gray sky in the distance.The location that the narrator remembered was much more beautiful.Most likely, all that lay ahead of him was his hometown.The narrator then describes his visit to his farm under a blue-black sky, standing in the middle of emerald green watermelons that stretched as far as the eye could see, and then discussing New Year's celebrations.He also talks about collecting shells near the beach, going to the beach before the spring tides, guarding the farm at night with his father, catching birds, slashing animals like badgers, porcupines, and others, and so on.
%%Beyond the text:*%% a. Since the beginning of time, people have been moving around, always to new places.Write a 300-word essay about the Nepali migration trend.*
%%The Migration Trend in Nepal Nepal is a country where land is the most valuable economic asset because employment, development, and industrial growth are limited.
%%Nepal's mountainous regions now have a population that is larger than the land can support.As a result, people are moving to the Terai's more arable land.There are essentially two factors that influence rural to urban migration in Nepal: the Pull factor and the Push factor. It is estimated that hill and mountain regions account for 40% of Nepal's population and the Terai region accounts for 60% of farmland.Employment opportunities, physical facilities, entertainment options, a more secure future, social respect, and other thingsare the drawbacks.Contrarily, difficulties, poverty, unemployment, and lack of facilities, among other thingsare the drawbacks.
%%Intellectual migration is also caused by survival, resources, demand and supply, religion, and the economy.In the context of Nepal, numerous Himalayan and hilly residents migrate to Terai in search of better employment and trade opportunities.Additionally, there are those who leave for settlement.The nation has a lot of internal migration.
%%b. Look for a friend or relative who has moved away from their old home to a new location.Prepare a report on how he or she felt when leaving the previous residence after speaking with them.
%%My uncle, aunt, and her two children, as well as his parents, have recently moved from a remote village to the capital city of Kathmandu because he bought a beautiful house there.
%%My conversation with him indicated that the uncle had returned home after ten years away from the city.He gathered the necessary items, sold the furniture, and gave something to his neighbors as a donation.Uncle also gave his neighbors some kitchen supplies.He had a fondness for his neighbors.He missed the places where he had fun with his loved ones and spent his childhood with his friends.At the time of his departure, he discovered that his relatives were standing at his gate.They seemed down.They were curiously observing Uncle and his family.They all said "goodbye" to him.He left his previous residence after saying "goodbye" to everyone.

%%The main points:*
%%Shankar Lamichhane's "The Half-Closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun" is a straightforward tale told through dialogue between two characters:a guide and a tourist.It was part of the collection Himalayan Voice:published in 1991 as An Introduction to Modern Nepali Literature.The story takes place in and around Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal.
%%Both of the characters in the story take on the role of narrators.The first is a guide from Nepal, and the second is a tourist from overseas.The western tourist, on the other hand, tries to act knowledgeable by saying, "I could take you along your ancient ways."The Nepali tour guide responds, indicating that he is more knowledgeable about the issue at hand. "You are my tour guide for today, but I feel I can help guide you as well," he says.

They also look at how the King built relationships with his neighbors, which is shown in the picture and told by an old man to his grandson.The traveler is thrilled by the inviting grins he gets any place he goes, contrasting it with the rancher's child getting back from difficult work and expecting himself and individuals' neighborly way of behaving.For the lovely smile of the Nepalese, they have one more drink.
%%After that, they investigate various other kinds of eyes, including the eyes in the windows, the eyes on the door panels, the eyes on the stupas, the eyes of the people, the eyes of the Himalaya, and the half-closed eyes of Lord Buddha, referring to the nation as a land of eyes.These eyes show a new civilization, a variety of religions, a new culture, vivid memories, and a long journey.
%%The aide tells about the sanctuary of Adinath, the Shiva hallowed place encompassed by a few different pictures of Buddha-a residing illustration of Nepalese resilience and concurrence however the aide takes the visitor to a house where he finds the beat of the real world.It is a farmer's family with a paralyzed child (a polio-affected boy) whose entire body is worthless. He cannot speak, move his hands, chew his food, or even spit—his eyes are just opposite those of his sister.The parents are overjoyed as the guide introduces the visitor as a doctor.There is a profound faith, connection, kindness, and gratitude in their eyes.
%%Finally, the guide adds that these are the eyes of the mountains, and the rows of fields on their lashes represent fields where wheat and rice mature in the winter and rain.They are just as lovely as the Buddha's reflection in the setting sun.

%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. How does the traveler portray his underlying feeling of the Kathmandu valley?
%%The tourist describes the Kathmandu valley as green, with geometric fields, earthen buildings in red, yellow, and white, the scent of soil and mountains in the air, and earthen buildings.
%%b. The tourist inquires as to why the West owes the East money.*

%%d. Why do tourists believe that Nepalese people are exceptional and wonderful?
%%The Nepali people are regarded as wonderful and exceptional by tourists due to their capacity to create exceptional wooden images, numerous ornaments and beautiful images of deities, enchanting music produced by traditional musical instruments, and hospitable behavior during a variety of cultural and religious ceremonies.

%%j. Why does the tour guide show the tourist examples of poverty?
%%The tourist is shown examples of poverty by the guide to help him understand the terrible poverty of people who live in remote areas, as well as their lack of safety and modern conveniences despite their friendly demeanor.
%%Reference to the Context*%% a. In order to tell the story, the author employs which narrative technique?What sets this story apart from others you've read?
%%➜ Shankar Lamichhane, the creator, involves the continuous flow as an account method to portray the story "The Half-shut Eyes of the Buddha and the Gradually Sinking Sun."
%%The majority of other stories I've read are told in the first person, with the narrator or persona describing the events in his own words. This story, on the other hand, is told through the monologues of two characters—a tourist guide in the Kathmandu Valley and a foreign tourist.In addition, in contrast to conventional narratives, the narrative depicts the thoughts and feelings of the two protagonists through a method known as "stream of consciousness" rather than "actions and events."In this context, stream of consciousness is a writing style or storytelling method that reflects the natural flow of a character's long mental process. Typically, this is done by including sensory experiences, memories, unfinished thoughts, unusual syntax, and sloppy grammar.However, none of the previous stories I've read employ this stream-of-consciousness method.
%%b. How does the author combine two narrative fragments into a single narrative?
%%The author of the book "The Half-Closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun" makes an effort to combine two narratives into one by connecting them with eyes and two distinct universes.In addition to describing the jobs that people do for a living, the author describes community events.In contrast, he connects it to the world of farmers, where people are ignorant of the real world and suffer from a variety of traditional beliefs and diseases.
%%As a result, he conveys the message that one should see things through their deeper eyes and comprehend the true meaning of the situation by connecting two distinct worlds or conceptions—the East and the West.On the one hand, he associates the tour guide's journey with that of a tourist who is watching the thing, and on the other, he associates the tour guide's explanation of the significance of the places and activities with examples from his own eyes and his narrative techniques of stream of consciousness.
%%c. The story makes use of a few myths and historical figures.Gather these citations and demonstrate their significance to the narrative.*
%%The story "The Half-Closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun" by Shankar Lamichhane includes some allusions to mythology and history.The references and their significance are as follows:
%%Her contribution to making it possible for people to live in the valley is represented by the mention of Manjushri and his sword stroke at Chobhar, which caused the Bagmati River to overflow.
%%The Puranas, portrayals of metal and ivory adornments, palm leaf compositions, and copperplate engravings all exhibit that the Nepalese public are wealthy in culture, customs, religions, and workmanship creates.
%%The monks and nuns with their heads shaved represent "the samyak gaze," which means pure perception;a vision that sees everything in its natural state.
%%The mentions of Princess Bhrikuti and King Amshuvarma point to historical connections or relationships with Tibet and other neighboring nations.
%%The wonderful light of the dusk reflected in the Buddha's eyes shows Nepal as a nation of Buddha with a lot more expectations and tranquil opinions in individuals.
%%Nepalese tolerance and unity are on display in the Adinath temple.
%%d. The author discusses the eyes numerous times:the eyes of the shaved monks and nuns, the eyes in the door and window panels, the eyes of the Himalayas, the eyes of the paralyzed boy, the welcoming eyes of the villagers, and most importantly, the eyes of the Buddha that are half closed.Explain how the story's overall cohesiveness is enhanced by each instance of eyes.
%%The author of the story "The Half-Closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun" discusses the eyes in many places, including the eyes of shaven monks and nuns, which indicate "the samyak gaze," which refers to the vision that perceives everything in its true form.The painted eyes on the door panels and the eyes on the carved lattice windows.The eyes on the stupas, the eyes of the people, the eyes of the Himalayas, the eyes of the boy who is paralyzed, the welcoming eyes of the villagers, and most importantly, the eyes of the Buddha that are half-closed.All of these instances of eyes point to a land of eyes, a land that the Lord Buddha watches over with half-closed eyes.Even if all of the history books in the world were destroyed today, these eyes show a new culture, religion, natural beauty, and the land of Buddha.Through the eyes' memories, the journey takes on new meaning.
%%The author thus unites the story as a whole by connecting various instances of eyes to memories that people acquire and their unfulfilled appetites as they imagine something with their inner eyes and hearts.
%%Beyond the text, make a reference *%%a. Write an essay about living close to nature.
%% Living in Close Relationship with Nature: An Essay Nature is everything we see around us—trees, flowers, plants, animals, the sky, mountains, and forests, for example.There are many reasons why humans rely on nature, but survival is the most important one.Oxygen, water, food, shelter, medicines, and clothing are all provided by nature.The Earth's many hues are what make it so appealing to so many people.Air, water, animals, the sun and moon, among other things, are all part of nature.Both living and non-living things can be found in nature, which has vibrant colors.Animals, fish, and insects also receive shelter and food from the natural world.Nature is essential to the development and equilibrium of life on Earth.
%%Because it is the best place for people to live, nature is inextricably linked to people and almost impossible to live without.It provides organic farming, various energy sources, and other services.It should come as no surprise that we ought to assist people in minimizing damage caused by nature, reusing things, and recycling old parts to make new ones.To alleviate environmental stress and restore balance, people from all over the world should collaborate.

%%The main points:*
%%Gabriel Garcia Marquez's A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings tells the story of Pelayo and his wife Elisenda, who kill crabs in a rainstorm and find an old man with enormous wings in their courtyard.
%%Pelayo, a poor fisherman, comes across an elderly man in his courtyard who is homeless, lost, and has enormous wings.The old man speaks in a language that is foreign to him.He and his wife therefore speak with him in vain.After consulting a neighbor, Pelayo and his wife Elisenda conclude that the elderly man must be an angel who attempted to transport their ill child to heaven.Pelayo is instructed to kill the angel with a club by the neighboring woman.Their child's fever breaks out in the middle of the night after they lock the angel up in the chicken coop.Pelayo and Elisenda, on the other hand, are sorry for their visitor.
%%Father Gonzaga, the local priest, tells the people that the old man is probably a fake angel because he doesn't speak Latin and is dirty.Father Gonzaga decides to consult his bishop for guidance.He says he will find out the truth from higher-ups in the church.The courtyard quickly takes on the appearance of a market as word of the angel spreads like wildfire.After that, Elisenda comes up with the brilliant idea of charging five cents for the angel's visit;They quickly accumulate wealth.Even when the crowd pulls his feathers and throws stones at him to get him to stand, the elderly man mostly ignores them.At the point when the guests singe him with a marking iron to decide whether he's as yet alive, he ends up being furious.Father Gonzaga works tirelessly to keep the crowd under control while Rome takes its time deciding whether the old man is an angel.
%%The crowd begins to disperse when a Spider-Girl-themed traveling freak show arrives in the village.She answers questions from spectators and describes how, one night, she was transformed into a tarantula for disrespecting her parents.The general public will find this more appealing than an elderly man with wings who does not pay attention to those around him.Pelayo's courtyard is left empty as a result of the curious crowd's immediate preference for the spider over the angel.People quickly forget about the old man, who had only performed a few meaningless semi-miracles for his pilgrims, because the sad tale of the spider woman is so well known.
%%Despite this, Elisenda has made Pelayo and Elisenda a lot of money by charging admission fees.Pelayo quits his job and starts building a bigger new house.As the little kid becomes older, the old man stays with them for a considerable length of time, living in the chicken coop.
%%They keep their child away from the chicken coop and ignore the angel.They begin to accept him as soon as he integrates into their lives.He receives frequent visits from the child.The elderly man enters the adjacent shed when the chicken coop falls, but he frequently wanders through the house, causing Elisenda annoyance.
%%They believe he will pass away as he gets sicker and weaker.But he gets better quickly.He starts singing sea chanteys, or songs of sailors, to himself at night as his feathers regrow.Elisenda is relieved to see the elderly man disappear as she watches as he spreads his wings and takes off into the air.
%%In conclusion, the old man appears in the backyard of a family on a stormy night as his eponymous (erroneously titled) persona.Additionally, it demonstrates the combination of reality and illusion—a narrative that appears to be real while also incorporating elements of imagination.
  

%%Comprehending the text, answer the questions below.*
%%a. In the story's exposition, how does the narrator describe the weather and its effects?*
%%In the story's exposition, Pelayo was dumping the crabs inside his house into the water after it had rained for three days.The beach's sands, which had glowed like powdered light on March nights, had turned into a stew of mud and decaying shellfish, and the sky and sea had become one ash-grey entity.
%%b. Describe the odd elderly man Palayo and his wife first meet in their courtyard.
%%The unusual elderly man was dressed as a rag picker—a person who collects and sells rags—when Pelayo and his wife Elisenda found him in their courtyard.His large buzzard wings were filthy and half-plucked, entangled in the mud, and he was in the terrible state of a drenched great-grandfather, with only a few faded hairs remaining on his bald head.
%%c. For what reason did Pelayo and Elisenda lock the elderly man up in the chicken coop?*
%%After discovering that the old man was an angel who had come with a plan to steal their child, Pelayo and Elisenda locked the man up in the chicken coop.
%%d. Why did Father Gonzaga doubt that the old man was a messenger from the heavens?*
%%Because the old man didn't even know how to greet his ministers or speak God's language, Father Gonzaga was unsure if the man was a celestial messenger.
%%e. A large number of people congregated at Palayo's house to observe the odd old man.Why, in your opinion, did the crowd gather to see him?*
%%To see the strange old man, a lot of people congregated at Pelayo's house.I think the people who found him inside the chicken coop wanted to see him and have fun with him as a circus animal.
%%f. While the crowd waits to see the strange man, a few miracles took place.What miracles are these?*
%%While the crowd gathers to see the strange man, a few miracles took place.These are the miracles:
%%The blind man who lost his sight but gained three new teeth, the paralyzed person who was unable to walk but nearly won the lottery, and the leper whose wounds produced sunflowers are all examples of this.
%%g. Describe the annoyances caused by the people's interactions with the odd old man.
%%The strange old man's inability to impress the crowd began to irritate him.To get him to stand, they threw stones at him and pulled his feathers.They burned him and poked him with a branding iron.At first, the elderly man did not respond to them, but eventually, as the pain became unbearable, he became aggressive.
%%h. In what way and for what reason did the woman become a spider?*
%%The woman was transformed into a spider by the lightning bolt of brimstone that broke through the tow of the terrifying thunderclap in the sky because she had sneaked out of her parents' house without their permission to dance.
%%i. Describe Elisenda's vision of the odd man flying over the houses.
%%When Elisenda sensed a wind coming in from the high seas while she was cutting onions for lunch, she ran to the window and saw an angel trying to fly for the first time.Despite the risky flapping of an elderly vulture, he miraculously maintained his balance and made it through the last few houses.She kept gazing at him until she could no longer see him.
%%Referring to the Situation* 
%%a. When a strange old man shows up in Palayo's courtyard, there are a lot of questions and theories.Describe the manner in which the neighbor's woman, Father Gonzaga, and the doctor refer to the odd man.Why do you believe these three individuals offer three distinct interpretations?*
%%➜ The appearance of a weird elderly person at Pelayo's patio stirs numerous doubts and clarifications.According to the neighbor woman, who knew everything there was to know about life and death, he was an angel who must have come for the child, but because he was old, he fell into the rain.Father Gonzaga, the parish priest, had doubts about the old angel because he was unable to comprehend God's language or perceive his ministers.He advised others not to be inventive to avoid the dangers of being curious because his frail feathers smelt of the outdoors.The doctor heard a whistling sound in his heart and kidneys, which showed that he couldn't be alive. When he saw his natural wings, he was shocked and wondered why no one else had them.
%%Father Gonzaga, the neighbor woman, and the doctor all give different descriptions of the strange old man.Because the strange old man's appearance and actions were so dissimilar to those of the real world, I believe these three people offered three distinct explanations for him.His language was also hard to understand, and he had wings.
%%b. This story falls under the category of "magical realism," which Gabriel Garcia Marquez perfected in his novels and short stories.A narrative technique known as magical realism is one in which the storyteller paints ordinary events with a magical hue, making them appear simultaneously magical and real.Argument for why you think the story's five magic-realist events are magical
%%This story falls under the category of "magical realism," which Gabriel Garcia Marquez perfected in his novels and short stories.For instance, the old man in the title "A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings" is portrayed as a magical character or a mythical being.The following is a list of the story's five magic realist events:
%%After disposing of the crabs, Pelayo was on his way back to the house when he noticed an elderly man lying face down in the mud, hindered by his enormous wings.The fact that humans do not have wings in the real world makes it magical.
%%The old strange man replied to Pelayo and his wife in a foreign language with a strong sailor's voice, implying that he was from another planet.
%%The neighbor woman claims that the elderly man is an angel who has arrived to transport the ill child to heaven."Heavenly messenger" itself alludes to an otherworldly connection in the story.
%%Father Gonzaga warned others about the strange old man and compared him to the devil.Both the capture of the elderly man and Father Gonzaga's description are amazing and magical.
%%The woman's transformation into a spider as a result of the brimstone lightning bolt, the doctor's prediction about the strange old man and his observation of a whistling sound in the old man's heart and kidneys, the old man's antiquarian eyes, his first flight attempt, and his passing over the last houses, among many other things, are not typical of what happens in the real world.Consequently, the storey belongs to the "Magical Realism" subgenre.
%%c. The story of a woman who became a spider because she disobeyed her parents is introduced by the author.People's attention immediately shifts from the strange old man to the spider woman during this episode.Why, in your opinion, did the author bring about this change in the narrative?*
%%The story of a woman who became a spider because she disobeyed her parents is introduced by the author.People's attention immediately shifts from the strange old man to the spider woman during this episode.I believe the author intended to show a magical connection between two distinct events by introducing this change in the narrative.The author wants to tie the storey to the magical realism world by depicting something strange or amazing happening in the world because the storey has elements of magical realism.
%%There is a sense of "magic realism" surrounding the strange old man.He shows how blind people are to beauty and mercy;He resembles Christ in some way.The Bug young lady is a person in a voyaging festival show that visits the town.It just so happens that the main draw is a spider-girl.The locals are stunned.In contrast to the shy angel, who shied away from attention, she entertains the audience and watching her is much less expensive.The general public will find this to be more appealing than an elderly man with wings who looks down on those around him.The curious masses quickly choose the spider over the angel, leaving Palayo's courtyard empty.The audience also enjoyed the morality tale of the spider girl's parents' disrespect and God's transformation into a spider.The angel is almost completely lost on the crowd.It also argues that entertaining and interesting activities are preferred to serious ones.
%%d. The story manages the ordinary citizens' guilelessness.How do Palayo and his wife profit from the whims of the common people?*
%%A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings is a brief story about the gullibility of everyday people.Pelayo and his wife Elisenda come across an elderly man with wings in their courtyard and attempt to speak with him without success.After that, they call the woman who lives next to them, and she informs them that the elderly man is an angel and that it was on its way to pick up their sick child.Their child's fever subsides in the middle of the night after they put the angel in the chicken coop.When they return to the courtyard at dawn, the entire community has gathered to observe the angel's appearance, despite their decision to let him go.Soon after, Father Gonzaga appears and declares that the elderly man is a hoax.
%%He says he will find out the truth from the highest courts of the church.The angel's story spreads like wildfire, and the courtyard quickly takes on the look of a market.After that, Elisenda comes up with the brilliant plan to charge 5 cents for admission to the angel;They quickly accumulate wealth.Father Gonzaga works tirelessly to control the crowd while they await their verdict.Pelayo and his wife exploit the whims of the common people by charging visitors to see the elderly man in this manner.
%%Beyond the text:*%% a. An irresistible crowd waits in line for days at Palayo's house just to look at the strange old man.Describe an incident from your own life or a story where people gather in groups for no good reason.
%% Palayo's house is crowded with people who can't resist looking at the strange old man for days.The poem "Night of the Scorpion" by Nissim Ezekiel depicts a similar scenario.The subject of the poem is a specific incident.When a scorpion entered their home and stung his mother before fleeing into the rain after it had rained continuously for ten hours.Like swarms of bees, all of the farmers in the area gathered.To slow the Scorpion's movement, they called God's name.With lights and lanterns, they started looking for it.They were unsuccessful in finding the scorpion.They observed that the scorpion's movements carried the poison through his mother's veins.They guaranteed that it would wash away her transgressions from her past birth and reduce the catastrophes of her next birth.They claimed that poison would purify her physical and spiritual ambition.As they spoke, his mother was in pain.He had a rational skeptic father.He had been playing around with mixes, plants, and powders.He even applied paraffin to the bitten toe and set it on fire.However, after 24 hours, the pain subsided.The fact that the Scorpion chose her and spared her children from being stung was praised by his mother to God.
%%b. Children and adults have different tastes.What distinguishes "The Old Man with Enormous Wings" from other children's tales?*
%%Children's preferences differ from those of adults.The following elements make "The Old Man with Enormous Wings" a story for children:
%%Characters:The old man is depicted as an angel with out-of-the-ordinary wings and the appearance of neither fully human nor surreal.
%%Conflict:Concerning the old man's character, the characters, such as the neighbor woman, Father Gonzaga, and the doctor, etc., engage in contention or conflict.
%%Fun times:The situation takes on a comedic turn when the crowd congregates in the yard to observe the elderly man and even pay the five cent admission fee to see the angel.
%%Setting:The story takes place in the rainy, muddy outside with chicken coops, the beach, the woods, the yard, and other locations.
%%Five percepts:The story uses some of the five senses, such as the sight of the crowd and the old man, the smell of his dirty body, and feelings of the various characters and crowd.
%%Structure and devices of the sentence:The story makes use of symbols and simple sentence structure.Wings: The elderly man is a Christ-like figure who comes to save people but is rejected and humiliated by them.Wings symbolize strength, speed, and unrestricted mobility.Angels are frequently depicted as beautiful winged figures in Christian art.
%%The Female Spidey:The erratic approach to faith that many self-centered individuals take is symbolized by the spider girl.
%%Things supernatural:The elderly man's wings, the woman's transformation into a spider, the belief in angels, etc.
