%%e. When do you think Famous Actress really excels in the acting world?*
%%I think the famous actress is very good at acting when she tells the honest woman that her husband is playing a game on her to make her jealous so that she will change her attitude and try to impress him as much as possible.The Earnest Young Woman grants her request for a hairpiece.She asserts that Alfred possesses it out of fear that her fans will steal it and give it to him.

%%b. Draw attention to the distinctions between a regular woman and an actress.*
%%The difference between an ordinary woman and an actress is that the former is extremely intelligent while the latter is easily fooled due to her nervousness.
%%In "A Matter of Husband," the ordinary woman is depicted as foolish and terrified, easily deceived by the actress's fictitious narrative.Convinced that her husband was having an affair, she had arrived at the actress in tears.The actress, on the other hand, convinced her that her husband was trying to reclaim his love for her by making her jealous.She gained the ordinary woman's trust, and she accepted the narrative without question.

%%"The relationships between the characters in this play are determined by money."Money plays a significant role in the lives of Mr. Durand and his daughters in the play "Facing Death."The most fundamental problem in this play—money—is the first and most pressing one.The financial difficulties of Mr. Durand's family have caused the entire family to live a miserable life without many essential necessities.Due to starvation, this family is in a precarious situation.The family's financial situation prevents them from purchasing bread.Mr. Durand has been starving for a long time.He is even shown eating rat food in the scenario.Mr. Durand is unable to provide for his daughters' basic needs because of the economic climate.

%%In the play "Facing Death," Mr. Durand is portrayed as a sad protagonist who takes his own life by drinking poison and setting fire to his house to get money from the fire insurance company to help his daughters out financially.Mr. Durand has consumed his entire time on earth in financial difficulty.His daughters have primarily placed blame on him as a result of the financial crisis.He is perceived as a negligent and failing father.His strategy for the well-being of his daughters demonstrates that he is a caring parent who is concerned about their children's future.He is the father who sacrifices his life for the sake of the future of his three daughters.
%%g. Talk about Facing Death as a contemporary tragedy.*
%%We refer to a play as a "modern tragedy" when we talk about one that deals with tragic events and has a tragic conclusion, particularly one in which the main character dies.Due to the tragic death of Mr. Durand, the protagonist, the drama "Facing Death" is a contemporary tragedy.The portrayal of prevalent issues accurately is a major concern in contemporary tragedy.Realism and naturalism characterize contemporary drama.
%%A contemporary tragedy's main character is a common man.Additionally, contemporary issues like loneliness, broken family ties, and sociocultural issues are addressed in modern tragedy.Characters suffer as a result of their fate, economic status, gender, socio-cultural environment, and other factors.All of the characteristics of contemporary tragedy are present in this play.
%%This play portrayed the existences of a standard present day man carrying on with a significant life emergency.The financial difficulties have been extremely hard on him and his three daughters.The play's problems with bad relationships and low economic standing may be easy to spot.
%%As a typical modern man, Mr. Durand has experienced a great deal of financial hardship.Mr. Durand, the drama's protagonist, dies tragically at the end.He kills himself and even burns down his house for his three children.Realist and naturalist elements were present in this play.
%%Beyond the text: *%%a. Write a few paragraphs that explain the father's role in the family.*
%%Fathers unquestionably play a significant part in the family.Being a father is more than just a position.My opinion is that a father is someone who adopts or accepts the role of parent and acts as a parent to someone else at any time.There are a lot of roles and responsibilities that fall on a father in the family.The role that a father plays in the family is very important to the mental and physical health of his or her children.At the point when a kid has a positive relationship with a caring dad, the person in question is bound to have great mental wellbeing and more grounded connections sometime down the road.
%%The father's primary responsibility in the family is to provide, make sure the family has a home, provide necessities, and pay for school, health care, and other costs.It is the father's responsibility to raise his children in a moral and societally acceptable manner.The father has an obligation to instruct his children so that they have a solid foundation for easier stepping and rising.The father is obligated to uphold his own integrity and reputation.Additionally, the father plays a crucial role in decision-making.From a cultural and socioeconomic standpoint, the father's accent helps make certain judgments.
%%b. According to Emile Zola's well-known essay "The Experimental Novel,"The experimental novel consists of these elements:to understand how things work, to show the machinery of his intellectual and sensory manifestations under the influence of his environment and heredity, as physiology will show us, and finally to show man living in social conditions he created, which he changes every day, and in the center of which he experiences a constant transformation.How much do you agree with Zola's theory that a person's environment and genetics influence both their intellectual and emotional abilities?*Use examples, such as "Facing Death," to discuss.
%%I wholeheartedly concur with Emile Zola's theory that a person's environment and genetics determine both their intellectual and emotional capacities.
%%Monsieur Durand is portrayed as a widower, lodge owner, and former railway worker in the play "Facing Death."He is a monetarily depleted man with three girls.The lodge is where they all live.The bond between Durand and his daughters is fragile.We see him as a loving, caring, and protective parent in this play.Because of his bankruptcy, he and his three daughters are having a difficult time of it.His daughters resent him and frequently place blame on him.However, he continues to worry about the welfare of his daughters.Because his daughters don't like him, he gives up his life.He is a patient man who was wronged by his late wife and remained silent throughout his life, blaming her for his financial woes.In addition, he is a loving husband.Even though he is forced to live in Switzerland, he is a patriot who adores France.He is a sad hero who suffers from financial difficulties before tragically taking his own life for his three daughters.
%%Durand took his own life because of his environment, as well as his personal and financial circumstances.He no longer had control over his mental and emotional health as a result of his bankruptcy.Since he loved his daughters, he initially considered their future.Durand had a hard time paying all of his debts and bills.In order to ensure that their daughters will have a secure future thanks to payouts from fire insurance, he intends to commit suicide by drinking poison and lighting the house on fire.Similar to the well-known essay "The Experimental Novel" by Emily Zola, Durand's intellectual and emotional powers are determined by his surroundings, environment, and circumstances.

%%Summary:*
%%Bhimnidhi Tiwari, a well-known Nepali poet and playwright, wrote The Bull, a one-act play.The 18th-century society's feudal system was criticized in the play.Male, King Rana Bahadur Shah's bull, dies, and the drama shows the terror that three important characters, the bull doctor and two cowherds named Jitman and Gore, are going through.
%%The play takes place in 1854 B.S., during the month of Ashwin. At the beginning of the play, Gore and Jitman, two frantic cowherds, arrive at Laxminarayan's house.They have arrived to inform King Ranabahadur Shah of his bull's passing.After hearing their story, Laxminarayan feels a chill in his spine.Concerned about the king's impending punishment, they are all.They can be put to death by the monarch.Laxminarayan is terrified of having his head shaved as a punishment.Laxminarayan's lips were once burned as punishment for speaking loudly in front of the monarch.Laxminarayan never grows a moustache on that side after that.
%%According to both cowherds, the bull died because it couldn't digest fine rice and split gram soup and didn't eat enough grass.Laxminarayan tells the cowherds not to tell the king that the bull has died.If they tell the king about the bull's death, they will face a terrible fate.Laxminarayan goes to the Basantpur palace to inform the monarch of the bull's poor health, following his advice to the two cowherds.Laxminarayan informs the king of the sick bull by bowing respectfully in front of him.He doesn't tell the king about the bull's death right away.
%%He tells the king about the condition of the sick bull.He asserts that the bull sir does not rise to eat breakfast.He does not speak or move.He just closes his eyes and looks at us.Laxminarayan begins by praising the bull for its beauty, style of walking, and heroism in battle.In order to assist with climate change and the bull's health, he suggests moving it to the hill.The king decides to personally inspect the bull's condition after hearing Laxminarayan's statements, so he takes a palanquin convoy to the cowshed at Thulo Gauchara.
%%Jitman and Blood, then again, are both standing by fretfully at the cowshed for the ruler's choice.They think about running away to save their lives, but they are afraid they will be found and killed once more.The king is headed there now.Laxminarayan advises the cowherds to massage the bull's back feet and wave the fan at the bull at Thulo Gauchar before the convoy arrives.They reciprocate.Laxminarayan even assures the king that they have been taking care of the bull since before dawn.The bull has truly passed away on the mattress.The area has not seen any movement.It is not eating or breathing.It has loosened its tail and drooped its ears.The cowherds and Laxminarayan delay declaring it dead out of fear.King Ranabahadur Shah says the bull is dead.
%%After hearing the king speak, Jitman starts to cry and says that the bull's death left him an orphan.He receives a 400-rupee tip from the King and is instructed to remain silent.Gore also starts to cry.He asserts that the bull is more significant to him than his wife, children, and parents.He declares that he will either hang himself or join the bull.After hearing his speech, the king gives him a tip of 500 rupees.Laxminarayan finally starts to cry and act like he's in pain.He is taunted by the king and told to bury the bull, oversee the burial, and offer sacrifices to the priest.Gore and Jitman finally express their happiness at being alive.
%%The feudal system of the time, in which ordinary people were oppressed, dominated, and dehumanized, is beautifully portrayed in "The Bull."Compared to the animals of commoners, feudal lords' animals deserved more respect.It examines how rulers dehumanize the common people, enslave Lords and Kings' servants, and rule the upper classes.

%%Reference to the Unique circumstance*
%%
%%a. Examine the late eighteenth-century Nepali society as depicted with regards to the connection between the lord and his subjects as depicted in the play.
%%Nepal was ruled by a monarchy at the end of the eighteenth century.At the time, the Shah Dynasty held power in Nepal.At the time, society was pretty strict.Freedom was lacking in everyday life.The king and his people had to rule the people's lives.In the play "The Bull," a horrible society in which people had to live in fear of the kings and lords was depicted.The lives of ordinary people were not ideal.They were awfully treated by their masters.They were punished severely if they disobeyed their lords.We might see a great illustration of people's miserable circumstances in this play.
%%There were no fundamental rights granted to the people.The general public is not very knowledgeable about politics.Most societies had patriarchal ideals and rules.Throughout their entire lives, women were subjected to male dominance.Numerous females were allowed to marry males.The play depicts Laxminarayan with seven wives.It even appears that he has a second wife.The lives of the common people were completely under the control of the kings or lords.
%%b. What can we learn about the society of the time from Laxminarayan's relationship with his wives?*How much has Nepali society evolved since then?*
%%Laxminarayan is Ranabahadur Shah's bull doctor and a forty-year-old bichari (legal officer).He has had seven marriages during his life.He doesn't seem happy, even though he has seven women at home.He still intends to get married to another woman.He refers to each of his seven wives as "flat-nosed," "beautiful," "butterfly," "ugly face," and so on at home.He gave his spouses different monikers, exhibiting man centric strength as well as the condition of ladies in the way of life at that point.At the time, marrying a lot of women was a very common thing to do.Females were regarded as servants while males were regarded as superior.Women who were married were forced to live their lives under the control and dominance of their husbands.They were forced to rely on their husbands and spend the majority of their time inside their homes.The primary causes of all of these problems were illiteracy, child marriage, poverty, feudalism, and a lack of understanding among the population.
%%Since then, a lot has changed in Nepalese society.Nepali women's current situation is significantly better than anticipated.Women in Nepal have gained a number of rights over time thanks to the constitution.In today's society, the consciousness and literacy levels of Nepali women have significantly increased.They no longer rely on their husbands as much as they used to.Even closer to earning the same as men, they are on their way.In society, there is no male dominance.People who abuse women are subject to severe punishment in Nepal's constitution.The rights and empowerment of Nepalese women are the goals of numerous organizations in the country.The Nepalese Constitution guarantees equal opportunities to men and women in Nepal.In a number of fields, the majority of Nepali leaders are women.
%%c. Highlight the play's depiction of chakari practice.Have you observed this custom in your community?*
%%During the time that the kings ruled Nepal, the idea of chakari was very popular.The majority of people were involved in the chakari of their monarchs, leaders, and lords during the royal system.Chakari was a way of life where people hoped to become wealthy and advance in life.People were required to constantly perform chakari in front of their kings and lords in order to behave well.If they did not perform the chakari correctly, they would suffer severe consequences.
%%The one-act play "The Bull" frequently uses the concept of chakari.Laxminarayn Dahal, the play's main character, and two cowherds named Gore and Jitman frequently perform King Ranabahadur Shah's chakari.Laxminarayan has even been punished by the king for his bad deed of speaking loudly in front of the king.Laxminarayan is informed of the bull's demise by both cowherds.They all feel a great deal of worry about the monarch.Around the bull, they act as though they are extremely cautious.To placate the monarch, they begin to wave a fan and rub the bull's feet.They even call the bull "The Bull Sir" in front of the monarch.Both cowherds begin to cry uncontrollably when the king personally announces the bull's demise.Consequently, the play is full of chakari.
%%d. In what way does Laxminarayan deceive Ranabahadur?*
%%Laxminarayan outwits Ranabahadur with his tricks.He is a forty-year-old legal officer and a doctor of the king's bull.When Gore and Jitman inform him of the king's bull death, he rushes to the palace.He is skilled at praising the king.He doesn't quickly advise the ruler regarding the bull's passing since the lord might become irritated by the news.He informs the king of the bull's illness rather than the truth.In order to please the monarch and safeguard their lives, he even instructs the cowherds to massage and waves a fan at the bull as they approach the cowshed.Despite receiving excellent care and treatment right in front of the king, the king believes the bull died.Because of Laxminarayan's methods, the king does not believe them, and they survive the severe punishment.
%%e. Draw a picture of Laxminarayan's personality.
%%Laxminarayan Dahal is one of the main characters in this one-act play.He is the bull doctor for King Ranabadur Shah and a forty-year-old official.He is hitched to seven distinct ladies.He has seven women living with him, but he doesn't seem to be happy with any of them.He intends to wed the eighth woman.He makes good use of his intelligence when he learns that the king's bull died and acts quickly to save himself and the cowherds from the king's punishment.He goes to the king's palace, but he doesn't tell the king about the bull's death right away.He is well aware of the chakari (king's flattery).In order to please the king, the king tells the cowherds Gore and Jitman to massage and wave fans at the dead bull when the king arrives at Thulo Gauchar's cowshed to see the bull.Laxminarayan's clever demonstrations have added to the play's humor.Due to his deceit, the king spared them from severe punishment.Subsequently, we might guarantee that Laxminarayan is the person who has outmaneuvered the ruler with his craftiness and chakari.

%%a. Write a 300-word essay on "The Nepali Society:The Future, Present, and Past*
%%The Nepalese Community:The term "society" encompasses the group of people who live together and inhabit the same social territory in the past, present, and future.In comparison to its past, Nepalese society has undergone significant change and is currently undergoing rapid change.It will undoubtedly change significantly in the future.Nepal is well-known for its wide range of cultural practices.In Nepali society, people practice various religions and come from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds.
%%Nepalese society was very different from what it is today.There were various classes and groups of people.Social ills such as caste discrimination and untouchability resulted from the division of people.People lived in extreme poverty and were subjected to discrimination as a result of the rigid social norms of the time.They were forced to obey their lords and kings without speaking.If not, they were subjected to severe punishment and denied access to fundamental societal rights.Most of the populace was uninformed, and there was a general absence of mindfulness.The height of patriarchal ideals and standards.The nation was rife with the idea of feudalism.The lives of ordinary people were miserable under the feudalists.The idea of human rights and opportunities was foreign to them.The majority of people's lives were extremely difficult.At the time, women's lives were bleak due to their precarious circumstances.For their survival, they were completely dependent on men.Additionally, child marriage was quite common.
%%Nepalese society today is more open and technologically advanced.Nepalese society is moving forward.In terms of amenities like electricity, drinking water, roads and transportation, education, and so on, Nepali society has changed.Nowadays, people can use a variety of rights in a variety of situations.Women are granted rights and no longer have to rely entirely on their husbands to make ends meet.The constitution now guarantees people's rights.In comparison to the past, caste and class discrimination is rarely seen.It is not required of individuals to follow their lords or kings.However, people today are not entirely free of the idea of chakari;In order to attain wealth and status, they follow a variety of powerful people and politicians.The shady politics of today's society is the main drawback.In addition, culture and customs do not appear to be preserved in today's society in the same way they were in the past.
%%The future of Nepali society is entirely contingent on its populace.The pace of development is now quite sluggish in comparison to that of other developing nations.Patriarchal ideologies have not yet completely vanished from society.If the right people are chosen as leaders, culture and traditions are promoted and preserved, and patriarchal views are rejected, Nepali society will be much better than the rest of the world.
%%b. Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux states in his "Satire 9":
%%However, satire, always moral and always fresh, both delight and instruct the reader.
%%She frequently shakes some rooted foolishness of the age, if good sense, refine her sterling page.
%%Does the poet have your support?Consider the lines in relation to the play "The Bull" by Bhimnidhi Tiwari.
%%In the preceding stanza, Nicolas aims to convey to his readers that satire that is both novel and moral can simultaneously educate and entertain.If the satire serves a good purpose and is written with a good goal in mind, it may be able to shake some of the underlying errors and mistakes of the time.
%%Yes, I agree wholeheartedly with the poet because he wants us to understand how powerful satire can be.Negative aspects of society can be ameliorated through positive satire.
%%Bhimnidhi Tiwari dramatizes an incident involving Ranabahadur Shah's obsession with bulls in her play "The Bull" to sharply mock the feudal system, which dehumanizes humans to the point where their existence is dependent on how they treat four-footed animals like bulls.With the help of satire, Tiwari has provided his readers with a wealth of information—both positive and negative—about the society of the time.%%
